And the guy didnt have a defender within 20 yards of him. Nice TD but doesnt prove much in the way of offensive skills.	275	-0.502	team	0	gw4rdoy	Yeah, he did not feel any real pressure there, even the announcer pointed out he had lots of time.

1619579995.0	Patriots	We have JC Jackson, Jonathan Jones, and Jojuan Williams. Three good (and 2 starting quality) corners. I could see them trading gilly before the contract ends next offseason to get a return on him. If DMAC continue to play at a high level and dugger comes into his own the secondary could still be tight without gilly. I would not say moving on from him would be a rebuild move. It would capitalize on trading an asset youre going to probably lose anyways for a little bit in return.	482	0.6249	team	0	gw4rlx0	We have JC Jackson, Jonathan Jones, and Jojuan Williams.

1619580391.0	Saints	Winston this season, Tua longterm.Winston is a proven NFL starter with immense talent who has been here, and Tua was barely playing at a starter level. That said, its very optimistic to bet that Winston turns a total new leaf and capitalizes on his talent, and theres a reason Tua was the wellregarded prospect he was, and one rookie COVID year on a poor offense doesnt totally negate that.This is without knowing what Winston (or Tua, for that matter) will do, so Winston could totally fail and the answer is obviously Tua, or he could show legitimate promise as The Guy and someone we could realistically win a Super Bowl with, and to h*** with Tua talk. More realistically, Winston could play well enough to compete for a wildcard berth on the back of our roster but continue to leave us in a little bit of a purgatory.In that case that Winston has reached a ceiling and it isnt true franchiseQBcaliber, I think the opportunity for Payton to develop Tua would be preferable longterm just in case he can unlock something considering Tua is so young. If we had to spend significant capital to obtain Tua, though, Id rather someone else or especially go allin for a promising QB in the draft.	1192	0.9145	team	0	gw4sat0	Winston this season, Tua longterm.Winston is a proven NFL starter with immense talent who has been here, and Tua was barely playing at a starter level.

1619580607.0	Ravens	better still, look at the other QBs who have been plugged into this system RG3, Trace, and Hudley. They all vastly under performed when compared to Lamar. Granted they were never given great opportunities to really show case their abilities, but if it was truly a system you would expect at least an average level of play. They all have similar traits to Lamar, so what could be the cause? The answer is real simple Lamar is the system.	436	0.7998	team	0	gw4so52	better still, look at the other QBs who have been plugged into this system RG3, Trace, and Hudley.

1619580703.0	Titans	Josh Reynolds has shown flashes of great talent that was trapped behind a stacked WR room. I fully believe he can easily be a solid 2 at best and a really solid 3 at worst.My biggest argument against it is we should take the best available player at any given pick. This WR class is extremely deep and theres great talent to be found in the second and third. We should not be reaching just to fill a particular need. While its also a fairly deep OL, CB and EDGE class those positions arent as deep. Id rather us just draft the very best player available regardless of need as it may not be a need right now but it will be. Guard for example, Center, MLB, DL, etc.	663	0.9193	team	0	gw4stzg	Josh Reynolds has shown flashes of great talent that was trapped behind a stacked WR room.

1619580808.0	Lions	Well he obviously has more than a sliver of a chance at making the roster. Hes been horrible and I have no qualms with him being cut. But he is still a 2nd round draft pick who has played 2 seasons on a rebuilding team with a terrible LB corps. He still likely has a slight leg up on an UDFA or a man off the street. The FO only gets a select number of UDFA to invite to camp and if they can open a spot for another position because they still have a second round player on his rookie deal to fill a spot at camp, then they will do so. Again if hes not worthy of a spot he wont make the 53, but hes going to be at camp, and its insane how much of an issue youre making out of something so simple to understand.	710	-0.8275	team	0	gw4t0ab	Well he obviously has more than a sliver of a chance at making the roster.

1619581118.0	Titans	Generally I just believe the expected available talent at WR in the 2nd round is much better than the pool of CBs at that spot. Like you said, theres tons of great WRs, so many are bound to to fall to the second round. Id say 23 of the guys you mention will be there, plus other studs like Rondale Moore, Terrance Marshall, and Dyami Brown. The options in the second round are a bit more slim by comparison (Aaron Robinson, Kelvin Joseph, etc.)Therefore, if we were to pick at 22 I think its in our best interest to get one of those top 4 corners while we can (likely Newsome or Farley) and wait to take a great reciever at 53 (and possibly trade up a bit if a WR Jrob really loves falls a bit.)I do think drafting WR in the first round would be a more viable option if we could to trade to the 2530 range back in exchange for some more capital.My ideal scenario would be trading back in the first for the best available WRCB, then trading up in the second for the other (while hopefully maintaining at least one 3rd round pick).	1029	0.9915	team	0	gw4tj4s	Generally I just believe the expected available talent at WR in the 2nd round is much better than the pool of CBs at that spot.

1619581368.0	49ers	It shouldnt even take this article to explain why Fields is the obvious choice.From the sound of it, Niners are trading Jimmy G during or after the draft. That means they need a rookie QB who can step in right away. That takes away Lance as a possibility and leaves Fields and Jones.Jones has average measurables and only the medias assurance that he has a smart guy and can go through his progressions quickly. Even one of the brightest QBs ever, Peyton Manning, needed an entire rookie season before he could take the big leap forward. Same for Luck, same for Elway. And these were GENERATIONAL QBs.So all Fields has done is put together back to back superb seaons, while having all of the measurables every team is looking in a QB for todays game. To put that into perspective, of the 2 current QBs faster than him in the league, Kyler Murray has the better arm but lacks height to see over him own oline, which Lamar only has an average arm.And the thing that makes him different from a running QB is the guy is mostly a pocket passer who busts a big run only when needed. If Watson and Mahomes were obvious dual threat choices back in 17, then what does that make Fields, who is faster than both and has just as good an arm as Watson (obviously, we arent gonna compare anybody to Mahomes, who has arm talent that defies physics)?All we can do is hope that the Jimmy G trade rumors are false, which puts everybody back into play, and starts the whole rumor mill going again. But lets be honest, if you are running a business, why would you pay a guy 25m when he has failed to perform to his job expectation 2 out of 4 years here?	1633	0.9596	team	0	gw4ty39	It shouldnt even take this article to explain why Fields is the obvious choice.From the sound of it, Niners are trading Jimmy G during or after the draft.

1619581374.0	Cowboys	Hi there, collegiate athlete here with a similar injury. I dove for a ball and on impact I fractured two vertebraes, and herniated my L4 and L5 into my spinal cord resulting in numbness and tingling down my entire lower half. Very scary, at first. Never had surgery, but received 2 epidurals to relieve pain. I took 6 months to recover, but since then Ive been a full time, starting center fielder for my softball team. I know softball isnt high contact  but there is a lot of force exerted on my spine from diving and sliding. All in all, our injuries are similar and I think he will recover fine to (potentially) be a great NFL player. However, I would still rather have Horn or Surtain over Farley based on skillattitude.	724	0.4221	team	0	gw4tyer	Hi there, collegiate athlete here with a similar injury.

The hurts pick was becasue Doug felt the team needed insurance for when carson gets hurt if they were going to be tied to him long term (same thing the niners did with Montana Montana never played a full 16 games once young was traded for).They wouldnt have gone with the same approach in FA and the draft last year (an emphasis on speed for a vertical offense) to cater to Wentz if they were planning on moving on from him so quickly.  The move from Wentz was imo moreso to do with his serious regression into all of his s***** tendencies (not taking what the defense gives him, holding the ball too long, poor mechanics) and steep decline rather then what Eisen is suggesting.Imo they shouldve moved on from Wentz in 2018.  They wouldve gotten a kings ransom for him, and been able to keep the team in tact around foles for another playoff run.	879	-0.9329	team	0	gw4tz82	I dont think this was the plan.

So now we still have a 2nd round pick next year and Jones.Get creative with the cap. Ben Jones could be a prime cut candidate after June 1st andor restructure Lewans deal. Like I mentioned in another thread, we have a short winnow window. Tannehill is a good QB but I dont have much faith h*** age like Brady or Rodgers. Henry is has a couple of prime years left and then is a wild card every year after that and considering he has carried the offense the last couple of seasons, thats a lot of pressure.

Yeah he had a bad game, every QB does, but he consistently goes thru his progressions and throws to the open man, watching all of his 2 years worth of games will show that. The issues with his going thru reads are great to exaggerated and can be pretty easily coached by Shanahan. When he scrambles hes still looking to make a throw before committing to the run, theres more instances of that across numerous games. Opposite is Jones, who has the same issues as Jimmy when the play breaks down and he has to make something happen himself, he typically falls short. Hes laughably unathletic to the point where the pressure hes going to face in the NFL will destroy him if he doesnt get a whole lot better or become Tom Brady. He has to reset to make any throws on the move, and his arm strength is not up to par to consistently make every throw necessary.The best part of Fields game is his ability to put the ball anywhere on the field with accuracy, and thats a QBs first and most important job. He can make any throw, can throw on the moveoff balance, can buy time when the okay breaks down, and has the arm strength to put air under the ball or lazer it to his target, and he does that so much better than Jones does.In short Jones can make the shortintermediate throws in rythme, and plays well when everything else is going to plan and his guys can get open. He has good anticipation, but suffers when timing is off or when theres a tough throw to make.Fields can make any play, any time, anywhere. His physical tools allow him to do some crazy stuff, and combined with his great accuracy he can make any play you draw up. He needs to process a bit faster, but nothing working with a great offensive coach shouldnt fix.	1822	0.9961	team	0	gw4ujnu	Real passers actually keep their head up and progress through readsFields does this consistently.

1619581901.0	49ers	You might be right.  Well see. Ive stopped trying to read tea leaves since we have an actually functional front office that doesnt leak. Which is great (but drives us crazy). But just throwing out a reminder to the fans. Whomever we pick is our guy. This pick is huge and will push the franchise forward or set us back greatly. So worry less about value or who would have been available when and wait and see. Because no one would remember or care if KC traded up to 3 to grab mahomes (who was QB4 on most drafts just like Mac Jones). And if we pick Fields and he is mediocre or busts, no one will care that it was the best value.	630	0.9486	team	0	gw4uts0	You might be right.  Well see.

If we end up trading down and getting extra assets and we take him Im more comfortable with that.

1619582693.0	Colts	Trade back definitely. No way Ballard just keeps 6 picks. Probably trade into late first with a team like GBBuffaloRavens. Snag an extra 3rd, take best available OT in 1st. My guess would be Leatherwood. Senior Bowl guy and hits most traits Ballard likes. But if a guy like PayePhillips is sitting there at 21 somehow, I bet we take one of them. 99 sure we trade back though. In the second round I feel like Payton Turner would be a guy they like. Once again Senior Bowl, and hits most traits they like. Also if we dont go OT in the first, a guy like Radunz is a good option here. Senior bowl! Surprise surprise! Some might not like this but I bet they want another playmaker on offense. Nico Collins checks off all the boxes Ballard looks for. Im a very big fan of his and Id love him on the team. If that happens, could get a guy like Elerson Smith in the 3rd who checks off all the boxes. If I had a list of guys I like could possibly be a colt this weekend, Id go Alex Leatherwood, Dillon Radunz, Tevin Jenkins, Elerson Smith, Payton Turner, Nico Collins, Tommy Tremble, or Tyree Gillespie. I could definitely see us ending up with at least 1 of these guys in round 14. I also keep looking back a recent Irsay presser when he said corner is a need. Greg Newsome? Also shoutout Zach Hicks for his work he does in finding prospects that fit Ballards mold. Cant wait for this weekend and go colts!	1398	0.9953	team	0	gw4w3sj	Trade back definitely.

1619582907.0	Falcons	i think if they draft a QB, then teams will start offering big trades for matt ryan as a postjune 1st (like at least 2 1st rounders).  I dont think they would wait until after the season to deal matt ryan if the trade offers are good.  But if they want to keep matt, I think they draft pitts.	292	0.4854	team	0	gw4wfrx	i think if they draft a QB, then teams will start offering big trades for matt ryan as a postjune 1st (like at least 2 1st rounders).

And he would be a left tackle on the majority of teams in the league, it just so happens we have Stanley. Who, unfortunately, is now coming off a serious injury. You act like Brown is replaceable, that the draft is loaded with players like him. Yea I hope so, because we have a pretty big hole on the line now. And thats the thing, we arent going to get a player in the draft who can come in day one and play at Browns level. Everyone is focusing on the picks, and seemingly ignoring the fact that we got worse for the upcoming season.	805	0.5423	team	0	gw4wmuj	Generally speaking I try to be respectful, but this is one of the worst takes Ive ever read.

For each of the guys you mentioned, theres a Josh Rosen, a Paxton Lynch, and Dwayne Haskins. Does that mean we shouldnt try? Of course not, but at best, we have a 20 chance of the drafting THE QB of this class, and that numbers probably far lower since well get the fourth or fifth option. Call me a pessimist, but I believe that were sort of in a loselose situation for 2021 and its safer to bet on Drew Lock having a Josh Allen like improvement than to roll the dice on a rookie.	638	0.777	team	0	gw4wqeb	Of course theres always that possibility (although Mahomes didnt play as a rookie), but Id argue the list of first round busts is far longer than successes.

Same with Saleh, who most seem to agree that he was the golden goose in the HC race this offseason. Out of all the years that Ive been a fan, Ive never heard so much near unanimous consensus that these guys should turn the franchise around. This is their moments just as much as it is Zachs. Theyre all tied at the hip 2021 will be the 11th year since the Jets made the playoffs, which will tie the record for the longest drought in franchise history. I feel like this organization stands on a very big precipice. If these guys are truly the ones to turn it around, then this is it, they have to show it. If this experiment does wind up failing for whatever reason, then I will mark it as a metaphorical nail on the coffin for the franchise and fanbase. Now this doesnt mean the team will move, but the few fans that are left at MetLife, theyre probably gone too, and its gonna have to take a Herculean turnaround to sellout MetLife again with actual Jet fans lining the stadium.	1339	0.9555	team	0	gw4wxu3	Always love Rich.
