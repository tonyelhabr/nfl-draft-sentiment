DJ Fluker was s*** at run blocking so we would swap him back in. I truly think unless Philips got significantly stronger over the off season he will always be a liability in pass Pro. He is decent once he gets moving forward (insert clip of his run) but he is not strong enough to anchor and pass protect. If you go watch tape from last year he is constantly getting blown up.	588	-0.441	team	0	gvr1vhx	If I could grade him last year it would be grade D.

Took forever to write, because initially I wanted to do one of Fields as well, but just not enough time.  Yeah, I was weary about posting it because the JetNation and my now defunct Titans site both had ads to my real estate business and wasnt sure I wanted the negative attention.  Yeah, I think within the sub and Jets fans overall, there seems to be a sentiment that you are either team fields or wilson, and cant really like both.  Like those east coastwest coast rap battles in the 90s.  I just think Fields translates a bit better to the NFL than Wilson, but Wilson has skills to be a stud if things develop right.  I talked myself into GenoPettyDarnold and heck I even tried to think that Hackenberg could be saved so I know as soon as hes drafted, Im mentally throwing out the negatives.  We could pick like Jamie Newman and Ill find a way to be positive about it until things fall apart lol.	1035	0.7924	team	0	gvr2ah5	Thanks.

1619299500.0	Broncos	Interesting that youre not acknowledging any of his growth despite moving to 17th from 30th based only on your interpretation of the metrics. If you look at Drews season he really struggled with a new offensive system implemented during covid restrictions. But thats not unusual for even a veteran, look at Tom Brady for example. Four of his first 5 games he put up a QBR in the 40s and averaged a 53. He then turned it around and was a 76 over the last 6 weeks of the season.Injuries are something of a concern with Lock, and I think its telling that his first two games back were the worst of his season. I wonder how much the injury impacted his performance, although that Patriots game was also an outlier because so many of his receivers were injured and the backups had several drops in the end zone. Just like the Chargers game featured several easy drops by Jeudy that kept him under 300. I acknowledge the Raiders game didnt merit a great QBR, but he also threw 2 TDs with 0 INTs and over 300 yards with a passer rating of 103.6 so Im not going to hold it against him.Finally, I have to say the personal attack is b******** If you cant share your perspective without name calling, then it just shows how ridiculous your argument and thought process is.	1261	-0.9868	team	0	gvr2bhe	Interesting that youre not acknowledging any of his growth despite moving to 17th from 30th based only on your interpretation of the metrics.

1619299964.0	Eagles	Not necessarily.  You cant guarantee Miami wouldnt have found another trade partner. Or, if they still wanted to trade, their offer likely wouldnt have been more. These values get negotiated beforehand anyway. Listen to Howies latest press conference. He explains that drafrday trades are discussed ahead of time.So, for example, Howie probably talked to the Broncos and asked what they would take to trade down to 12. And they say next years second and this years fifth. Howie keeps that in mind. We can make the trade now, or wait until draft day. That deal is basically set in stone. Once the Broncos are on the clock, theres no time to negotiate Ahah! Gotcha Howie! Now I hold the cards. I want next years second and this years third as well! Muhuhahahah. Howie says, F*** off, mate, hangs up, and never trusts the dude again.Anyway, yeah, these deals are often made ahead of time  or at least they discuss 95 of the deal. Then if the guy we want drops to 7, we call the Lions, tell them well make the trade, and it happens. Reneging on a priorarranged deal would make other teams never want to deal with you. I dont think thats common practice at all.Plus, like Howie said, theres basically no time to make agreements when a team is on the clock. The potential trades are discussed ahead of time. then teams make calls during the draft depending on how the board falls on draft day.	1387	0.4657	team	0	gvr382l	Not necessarily.

Lack of pro style offense2. Was considered to be a gunslinger by some which is hilariously Colin cowherds knock on Wilson (33 TD  3 INT).Regarding Wilson my favorite tape to watch of his is actually the coastal Carolina game. For all the talk of his team being so much better than the opponents, the rest of BYUs offense got waxed that game.The offensive line let CC live in the backfield and play after play you see ZW thriving under pressure.You also see his wideouts dropping more passes  in bigger situations than youd ever expect Wilson to deal with at the next level. Additionally there are some bonehead penalties (first offensive drive is horrible), and a clutch time play where the offensive player runs backwards 20 yards. Even through all of that Wilson still got to the 1 yard line as time expired, throwing rope after rope trying to will his team to victory.Not only did that game show myself and anyone scouting him that he could thrive independently of his team playing well but it showed me that he could elevate the guys around him and probably had been the whole year.It also showed him how good he could be as evident by his final two games of the season. ZW was an absolute surgeon against San Diego state and central florida and the opponents couldnt have mattered less. He was a cat toying with his food, a man among boys, etc, etc, etc.	1550	0.6415	team	0	gvr3kgs	So this is actually in response to all of the TT Mahomes footage Ive seen.I dont think what Im saying is a huge hot take either, if you read the scouting reports the two reasons he dropped1.

They can afford something like 2 extra pro bowl caliber players in the diffence between his rookie salary and his upcoming salaries.Mahomes cap hit is 7.5 million and Cousins is 31 million. You can get a lot of oline help with that 23.5 million dollar differential. Also, you have the factor of guys willing to take less money to play with guys like Brady and Mahomes and chase a ring.You simply dont get the discount with Kirk	650	0.681	team	0	gvr3npe	 The Chiefs have a massive chance at winning the SB or multiple SBs in the next couple years if they invest in the guys around Mahomes, because his contract has been so low, is so low, and will just be starting to get bad.

1619300313.0	Jets	I really hope Saleh and the coaching staff clearly think they can mitigate the issues with Wilson, because the upside is great.  If he can be the QB that showed up in 2020, then the franchise is set for the next 15 years.  I like Fields better because hes done it for 2 years against better competition, and the athletic profile translates better to the NFL on a team that doesnt have an elite line.  Having that mobility forces defenses to be less aggressive in their blitzes, which paired with the run scheme fits better IMO.  I think Wilson has a higher upside than Fields, but Fields has a much higher floor without being too far off in terms of upside.  In football analogy, Wilson is the go route, Fields is the post route.  I have this weird feeling something is up behind the scenes with Fields.  I dont remember a top tier guy with this kind of consistent production against good reams and athletic skill get so downgraded.  Even Watson was mainly downgraded because there were concerns about his arm, and the Clemson system that hadnt produced anyone.  It could also be that without the usual combine and all, the media isnt as plugged in as they say.

They more than likely would have had to move up to get whoever they wanted  3...  after Lawrence and Wilson were gone.  Lance has a tiny sample size, playing outmatched talent on the most talented team in FCS.    Fields played on a stacked OSU team, and quite frankly OSU QBs have not panned out well in the pros.     Mac Jones played behind a stacked Oline, with 2 of the most talented WR in the draft, both who will be top 15 picks.  And the top RB more than likely in this draft.    I would much rather roll the dice this year with Hurts, see what he has.  And at worst you stink this year and have a top 35 pick with potentially 2 other first round picks next year to move up if you need to.	766	0.9126	team	0	gvr50l2	Im sorry but do you really want to draft Lance, Fields or Mac Jones?

1619300934.0	Packers	I love it, Im all here for draft talk!Yeah I get that. Im not necessarily writing them off but I think that Green is a substantially better prospect than any of them were a year ago. Equally if someone like Green isnt available I wouldnt mind rolling into 2021 with the existing guys.On Farley I guess its difficult to see this one eyetoeye. The injury drops him for me but hes still a top 20 prospect in my eyes. It is definitely a concern but I still expect him to be a quality starter and that is worth it for a first rounder.	529	0.9485	team	0	gvr53vb	I love it, Im all here for draft talk!Yeah I get that.

1619300937.0	Vikings	The only concern i have with Darrisaw is his lack of concentration. He has the ability to do anything. His technique, when he focuses, is very good. The problem is that he takes plays off, doesnt finish blocks, and plays down to the level of his opponent. When he plays his best, he can s*** down any opponent.	310	0.8777	team	0	gvr544j	The only concern i have with Darrisaw is his lack of concentration. He has the ability to do anything.

1619301140.0	Broncos	Again you are being obtuse on purpose. You want to talk about how Lock grew over the season. Yes he did improve, he went from the worst NFL QB, to the worst starter in the NFL. He finished the season by all measures 35th to 32nd. But again if we want to cherry pick and say Locks best 6 vs the rest of the NFL has him at 18 (not 17) then you have him still near the bottom. But since you are so h*** bent on this QBR, lets take a look at the last 6 gamesGames 69 QBR 78.33Games 912 QBR 49.7You want to keep saying he improved over his last 6 games. No he improved over games 69 and then regressed back to his average with 49. You cant keep saying he improved when 4th and 5th worst games came at the end of the season, against a couple of the worst defenses in the NFL. You are hiding bad data in good data, to make average data and then saying loom hes better. As for Tom Brady, you are comparing a QB who has been in the same system to 20 years, having to relearn everything with no offseason to Lock. The difference is Brady had confusion, Lock was just behind everyone else. Brady could have been getting mixed up, he also had a whole new lineup. Lock still had essentially the same Oline, the same RBs and 25 recievers. But you skipped over my part with the rookie QBs, who Cam eout of the gate faster then Brady and Lock, and everyone in the league finished better then Lock with a new system. Lock wasnt confused, he just doesnt know how to do simple things.Lock threw to his first read 77 of the time, most QBs are under 50. All rookies were under 50. Lock is a 1 read and throw. Did you know he had the 8th most open recievees thus year, but found the open guy at the lowest rate as per PFR? Locks injuries are a concern, and his worst performances coming back are on him. He came back early cause he saw that Driskel and Rypien if given more snaps, may outshine him.The personal attacks are fair, you are purposely leaving out data to make a point. You are attempting to win an arguement instead of presenting all the facts. You ask me to look at certain data points instead of the whole picture. You have been accused 3 times by me of using specific data to prove a point, have you accused me of the same? No because if you open up the floor to any data that isnt small and isolated, your arguement falls apart. Im not going to argue with you anymore. You have only presented bad data, and the average data you present (last 6 games) upon closer inspection can be broken down and shown to be bad. Had Lock averaged 78.3 QBR over his last 3 games, you may have a leg to stand on, but he didnt. Go do a real study, start with NFL stats and then at the end use the parameters you used for the NFL on Lock. Until that point you are attempting to convert people to your side with very biased data. When 2021 starts, Ill message you. If a rookie outperforms Lock, you acknowledge that I was right. If Lock is the starter and is bad, you acknowledge Im right. If Lock is the starter and is better, Ill tell you that you clearly saw something I didnt. If the rookie is bad, well just leave it. Gotta give him 2 years like all Lock supporters keep claiming.	3159	-0.9906	team	0	gvr5ipa	Again you are being obtuse on purpose. You want to talk about how Lock grew over the season.

1619301383.0	49ers	And 2017 is a perfect example in many ways.  Part of why people havent crucified our FO for that pick is that Thomas was considered a top 3 pick and Mahomes was not and went 10th.  So people are disappointed but there is some defense that no one gets every pick right and we followed accepted wisdom (i.e., no one gets fired for choosing IBM).Imagine though if Trubinsky was having Mahomes success (especially if Thomas was being projected as a midfirst rounder), theres be a lot more anger.There will be pressure to be right regardless of who we pick.  But if we pick Fields and Mac is way better, there will be far less anger and frustration than if we pick Mac and Fields turns out to be way better.	702	0.1663	team	0	gvr5zfj	And 2017 is a perfect example in many ways.

So people are disappointed but there is some defense that no one gets every pick right and we followed accepted wisdom (i.e., no one gets fired for choosing IBM).Imagine though if Trubinsky was having Mahomes success (especially if Thomas was being projected as a midfirst rounder), theres be a lot more anger.There will be pressure to be right regardless of who we pick.  But if we pick Fields and Mac is way better, there will be far less anger and frustration than if we pick Mac and Fields turns out to be way better.

1619301405.0	Jets	Ive been a fields guy since day one. Wilson is talented and is a good prospect. But the risk is significantly higher with him imo because of the lack of competition, the size,  the injury history, and some of the tape when hes under pressure isnt good and its rarely talked about. My only real concerns with fields are his elongated release. Seriously,  its painful to watch at times. And the occasional w** did you throw that ball decision. But I honestly think both of those can be cleaned up in the NFL or worked around.	523	-0.9529	team	0	gvr60wx	Ive been a fields guy since day one. Wilson is talented and is a good prospect.

1619301892.0	Eagles	Idk I rather being hold what people want when its time cruchIm not sure what these typos were exactly supposed to say. Lol. I think youre saying youd rather hold onto the pick and negotiate on draft day. But thats not practical. Teams do their due diligence, which means many teams are at least probing what it would take to move up in the draft. So several teams probably discussed with us what our asking price was. We couldnt just say, no, well wait until draft day. Then our 15 minutes come, and we have to talk to ten different teams to discuss who has the best offer. Meanwhile, if none come to an agreement, we need to be ready to submit our pick. Its often impractical to fully negotiate a trade in 15 minutes, let alone whittle it down from 10 teams to 1 AND finalize the trade.Like I said, this is what Howie says happens in the NFL. Teams negotiate these ahead of time, then pull the trigger when the board falls on game day.Also, I suppose it could go either way on draft day. But its better to have the guarantee trade thats clearly a win for both teams because you dont know if your trade partner makes another move or changes their mind in the meantime. Plus, guaranteed extra first round pick for is is better than hoping for the mere opportunity to try to squeeze an extra future day 3 pick out of a team because you think theyll be desperate on draft day. What do they say A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush? Yeah, I trust Howie made the right move. Six spots for a first rounder is more value than I would have expected.Also, its like Howie said  flexibility. So we can either keep extra draft capital for next year, or possibly move up with that extra 1 or another pick. That extra 1 next year might make Howie comfortable with trading our second next year to move up. Who knows.	1808	0.9967	team	0	gvr6yd8	Idk I rather being hold what people want when its time cruchIm not sure what these typos were exactly supposed to say. Lol. I think youre saying youd rather hold onto the pick and negotiate on draft day. But thats not practical. Teams do their due diligence, which means many teams are at least probing what it would take to move up in the draft. So several teams probably discussed with us what our asking price was.

Could easily trade one of our seconds and still get a good defensive player in the second. I think theres no other place thats gonna get Bateman more 1 on 1s than the chiefs. Plus it would guarantee someone is open every down. Bateman WILL beat almost any corner (especially on a certain cocky team from Tampa) in the NFL off the line and if they commit two defenders to him, Kelce and Hill will punish them for it. Not to mention you still have some decent depth, and a underrated gadget guy in Mecole Hardman.	642	0.0766	team	0	gvr7wjy	Future first and a second this year could easily get us to 2025 where hell likely be.

If he hits Matt Ryan hes still not the best QB.If Lance is the pick, its risky but if he reaches his potential now youre likely talking about a legit top 10 QB.

Everyone wants us to add a high end olineman, we are in James Daniels, excited to see him this year. The draft I want us trading up for qb if he falls in round 1 or take one in round 2.  Beyond that wrOline in first few rounds.  This draft needs to attack the question how does our offense improve.	814	0.6404	team	0	gvr9usa	Yeah I think people are looking at this season so far thinking were downgrading a decent amount at cb2 and upgrading slightly at qb so with a tough schedule were going to be awful.

1619303587.0	Ravens	My thoughts exactly.  Expert? No. Sports media employee? Yes.  So many people in this field have a hard time gauging talent or assessing personalities correctly.  Even, former pros have a hard time accurately assessing talent and it should be slightly easier for them, because they know what to look for having played the game, and even thats debatable.  There are so many factors that play into a players success in the NFL.  Look at Steve Young. He would have languished on the bucs roster if the 49ers hadnt made a move for him or believed in him.  Being in the right place at the right time has as much of an impact on a players success as being gifted or working hard.  While the possibility of the Ravens moving on from Lamar is insanely low, its not out of the realm of possibilities, but I dont see the FO taking a risk when they could stick with a known commodity (League MVP) who had a pretty good down year, all things considered.  Bucky Brooks is stirring the pot to stay relevant. Thats it.	1003	0.9452	team	0	gvra66s	My thoughts exactly.  Expert? No. Sports media employee? Yes.

Had he kept his head down, actually worked hard enough to show an actual attempt at winning the starting job but still got told no, then Id have much less of a problem with drafting him.

Warrick was a top 5 pick, Coles gets drafted (I believe) in the 3rd round. Warrick flamed out, Coles played as a solid 2 for 10 years.(The shopliftingdiscount thing played a role in him being a 3rd rounder though)	660	0.9891	team	0	gvrbyhv	Thats true but I think Justin Jefferson blowing up is another reason Chase is so high.

So, its easy to think that he would also be better right away in the NFL. Horn could take a bit longer to adjust to the NFL, but I still believe he could end up being our best corner by the end of the season (if Diggs doesnt have a major improvement), which makes either scenario perfect.	607	0.9763	team	0	gvrckgp	Both would be great for the Cowboys, so I dont know why were all losing sleep over this debate.

1619304915.0	49ers	A lot of that very well may be due to how Jones and Fields get treated differently by the media.  Theres been multiple analysis of the lack of actual scrutiny that the media has actually done for both Fields and Jones, in large part just due to the fact that Fields is a black quarterback who is fast on his feet.  Fields was basically immediately slapped with the Mobile QB tag, and everyone in the media took that as just another black QB who should be a running back but he thinks he can think, and immediately wrote off both his intelligence and his ability to perform in the pocket.  There were prominent media members who, upon questioning, revealed that they assumed he was a poor passer without actually looking at his stats or game tape, exclusively because he was a black mobile QB.  He was, through no fault of his own, assigned a label as athletic, poor passing, d**** lazy, with a host of character issues.Mac Jones, on the other hand, was seen as a good old traditional QB from down South.  Because he was seen as Fields biggest competition for the 3rd overall pick (since Lawrence and Wilson are all but locked for 1 and 2 at this point), he was unconsciously assigned all of things that the media had mentally dinged Fields for.  Since Fields was supposedly d**** Mac Jones is now smart.  Since Fields is a mobile QB, Mac Jones is now the best pocket passer.  Since Fields supposedly had character issues, Mac Jones is now the clean shaven high character choice.  In reality, Fields has more than proven his intelligence and character, both on and off the field.  Fields graduated with a 3.9 GPA and was offered a scholarship at Harvard University.  Hes never been the center of any controversies, and was wellrespected among his teammates as a leader and a hard worker, playing through injuries and health concerns for the good of the team despite the fact that he could have declared for the draft in 2020 and gone pretty high.  Really, when you look at Fields whole profile, theres really no dings against him, which means you have to question why the media keeps pushing all of these issues and labels on him without evidence, and it calls into question whether Mac Jones actually has all of these benefits or if hes just used as a tool to contrast against Fields.Anyways, thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.	2329	0.9839	team	0	gvrcnxc	A lot of that very well may be due to how Jones and Fields get treated differently by the media.

Coach Judge says it all the time versatility is crucial. Im pretty sure nobody expected Diehl to start two Super Bowls at LT for us when they drafted him as a LG in the fifth round.	472	0.9513	team	0	gvrd3ly	Five hole linemen are always valuable, because injuries happen.

Getting some backup DEs would be great for the team, but I dont think that the position should be considered with their first pick, unless they traded down to 19 or further and they were wiped out at other positions.	508	0.4503	team	0	gvre33y	I dont think so.

1619306321.0	Buccaneers	I suppose you think that were gonna need to keep our starting 5 OL and will retain our secondary? If so, thats a ton of money which we wont be able to spend on a FA QB     and     wed have fewer years on a QBs rookie contract (if drafted this year)Yea...for the most most part. I think Marpet, Capp, and Wirfs get retained. I think the Team cant afford to lose Davis, Whitehead and Edwards. MurphyBunting and Jamel Dean could possibly face competition in the next season or two based on their previous inconsistencies and struggles.Thats up to 2023.x200BMostly because Gabbert is going into his 4th (? 3rd?) year with BA. BA needs to be confident enough in his backup QB that he doesnt trash our whole passing game in the event that the second string guy has to play team minutes.Gabbert went 23 with Arians in Arizona. He threw 6 TDs and 6 INTs in those games. He threw for under 60 completion in 3 of those 5 games.He threw 3 TDs in his first appearance in Arizona and that sparked the hop he could be a factor. It just got worse as he went on.We know from Arians commitment to JW3 that h*** ride a QB right off a cliff and talk him up like we dont have access to the game footage. For clarity, I think the prospect mentioned in the post is a 3rd Round talent.	1262	0.8909	team	0	gvrf9eq	I suppose you think that were gonna need to keep our starting 5 OL and will retain our secondary?

1619306406.0	49ers	Yea thats my thought too. I think they were eying Jones at 12 as they felt he was the pick there but as his stock rose they traded up so they can be guaranteed to draft him. But like you said its not clear if they moved off of him, and my thinking is that they made the trade so that they could get AT LEAST Jones. He could very well still be the pick but they probably didnt do all of their Homework on the other guys because they werent possibilities at 12. This the pro days and the Beck working with Lance stuff, and here we are.The initial interest was Jones and could still be the case but the pool of options have widened.	629	0.8207	team	0	gvrfezy	Yea thats my thought too.
