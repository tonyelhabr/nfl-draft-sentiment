Overall, we cant let Pace making the wrong decision in the right moment deter us from ever taking a risk on a top QB in the future.

1619616133.0	Colts	No kidding. The Hurts pick showed tremendous foresight...especially after Wentz bombed.People love to ridicule that pick, but perhaps the GM who drafted Wentz saw it coming...or at least saw the need for insurance. And he was right. And considering they were picking 6...not sure how easy it would have been to fix QB. So for a team that needs to rebuild...they almost to see what they have in Hurts and stack draft picks. Rosemans recent track record in the draft isnt very good, but other than paying Wentz early, hes handled the QB situation about as well you could.	569	0.069	team	0	gw63fta	No kidding.

1619616142.0	Dolphins	This is a bit exaggerated.   All these FA contracts were designed so they could get out of them with little or no consequences.   Sure, Jordan Howard was a big L.   But Flowers was a 2 year deal.  At a point where they had a ton of cap space and needed an actual functioning NFL G.  If you thought Flowers was going to be in Miami long term, then you should be the subject of a snarky meme.   Lawson was flipped for a very good LB.   And Van Noy became expendable because of the emergence of AVG.  Thats what happens in a salary cap league.  Its chess, not checkers.  Start looking 2 more moves down the road.	609	0.485	team	0	gw63ggy	This is a bit exaggerated.   All these FA contracts were designed so they could get out of them with little or no consequences.

1619616311.0	Vikings	Honestly, given that if we dont make the playoffs we also likely arent a bottom10 team in the draft under any real circumstances other than Cousins gets hurt week 1. Also, the 2022 QB class doesnt appear to be good. So, I am really dubious about firing Spielman and Zimmer in 2022, simply because the 2022 Vikings will not really be a good destination for a GMCoach to come to. Id ride it out for one more year with them so that SpielmanZimmerCousins are all a package deal. I dont think you will convince a GM to come here when you are capped out into oblivion, and are kind of stuck with Cousins until 2022. The 2023 Vikings, where as a GM you can essentially walk into a blank slate since Cousins will be off the books, Cook will be at the point where his guarantees are running out and you could move on from him also, and you get some leeway to be terrible for a year or two and actually go for a full rebuild will be much more enticing. That said, I wouldnt shed any tears if we do miss the playoffs and the Wilfs clean house. I suppose if the new GM really wants to, they can get off Cousins contract  someone will take him even if we have to attach a 3rd4th5th or something to get off that massive cap hit. Then they can start the full rebuild early.	1258	-0.1078	team	0	gw63sng	Honestly, given that if we dont make the playoffs we also likely arent a bottom10 team in the draft under any real circumstances other than Cousins gets hurt week 1.

1619616436.0	49ers	I think Mac Jones will be a successful QB in this league. He might not be elite, but hes got the tools to do a lot of things well. I think the comparisons to Brees might be a little much, but I could see him reach that level eventually. Hes the prototypical pocket QB you want, minus the elite arm talent. But its not like hes got a noodle arm a la Chad Pennington. But hes smart, goes through his progressions, can read defenses (though whether he can read NFL defenses remains to be seen), can make all sorts of passes, throws receivers open, etc. Hes everything that we expected Jimmy G to be after the 2017 season. He is almost certainly going to be our QB in 2021.Hes just not the shiny new toy that we want. Its like going to the dealership and you see used Ferraris, Lambos, etc. and in the middle of the dealership, you see a MB Eclass. Of course, the Benz doesnt have the same appeal as the Ferraris and Lambos, so you dont want it. But (if youre like most of us) youve never really driven the supercar... sure the idea of it is great, but you dont know if youd even like owning it. But the MB... thats a car that you know is reliable and youve heard great things. But then again, its not a Ferrari or Lambo. Thats Mac Jones here.But I just dont want him as a 49er. Theres something about him I just dont like. Maybe its his personality. Maybe Im jaded by the other QBs available. I dont exactly know what it is. I just dont want us to draft him. Of course, that will all change if he brings us a Super Bowl.	1517	0.9908	team	0	gw641jh	I think Mac Jones will be a successful QB in this league.

1619616666.0	Dolphins	Hey man, really fair question that needs to be asked. I am personally SewellChasePittsSmithWaddle. My reasoning is mostly risk aversion and conservative draft philosophy. It is a fact that the NFL has been more successful in drafting tackles than receivers. We see this regularly, but it is also statistically true (see the link below).   I think we are better off using our highest draft capital in areas we are most likely to succeed. That is basically it. I also do not buy the idea that we are set at Oline. I think even if our young lineman progress nicely we will be average at best, and people seem to have forgotten that we drafted a QB whose major red flag was size and injuries. I also think if you want to improve your run game you draft lineman rather than RB (although I think we should draft both). In summary I think Sewell is a comparable prospect to the receivers at a position that still needs help, and that we are more likely to draft correctly at that position.   httpsbleacherreport.comarticles2441018whichpositionsarethesafestriskiestatthetopofthenfldraft(httpsbleacherreport.comarticles2441018whichpositionsarethesafestriskiestatthetopofthenfldraft)	1173	0.9897	team	0	gw64i66	Hey man, really fair question that needs to be asked.

1619617116.0	Broncos	Ill explain my view on Fields last...I agree that the Mac Jones to SF may just be smoke.  But if I had to give those particular rumors merit, maybe Kyle Shanahan wants a robot for a QB.  Someone who just gets things done.  Jones isnt flashy but his accuracy and decision making (when he isnt under pressure) may be something Shanny  Lynch value more at the moment.  Well see tomorrow.As for any rookie QB, my expectations are a bit low at first.  I root for them all, even the ones I wasnt high on at first.  Lawrence is a winner who was surrounded by talent in Clemson, so itll be interesting to see how he handles the defenses he faces have more talent than the offense he runs.  Same goes for Wilson in NYJ.  With that said, any of the QBs past those two, I just dont see the value in drafting them as early.  Fields, Jones, Lance, Mond, Trask, etc....  To me, they are all even more of a c*** shoot.  Fields and Trask had really good offensive weapons that they could rely on, too.  But if that group is the lessor of Lawrence and Wilson (again, all based on opinions and speculation), then Im never on board for trading up to draft those guys.  Any project guy for that matter.This Mond post was an opportunity to gage and learn how my fellow Broncos fans thought and I did learn.  Im reeled back in and am back to where I was in the beginning and that is I prefer we dont draft a QB at all.  Just give the Lock the keys.  Hopefully stabilityconsistency in the offensive scheme and OC is what he needs to live up to his earlier expectations (the odds are against him, but since were not in position to replace him with an actual upgrade (yes, I dont think Jones, Fields, and especially, Lance, is an immediate upgrade), I say we just go all in everywhere else on the team and hopefully it all meshes and all the key players stays healthy and we disrupt the division and rock the Chiefs world.  I admit, thats a high hope, but thats the hand I think were dealt for the time being.	1984	0.9902	team	0	gw65etr	Ill explain my view on Fields last...I agree that the Mac Jones to SF may just be smoke.

1619617122.0	Jets	Im not scared of Mac Jones. I think we see a lot of QBs like him in college and since they dont have elite physical traits it doesnt translate to the ramped up speed of the NFL. I look at Mac Jones and see zero impressive physical traits. He can read a defense and he does have good ball placement but these are things that can be said about guys like Colt McCoy, Matt Leinhart, Jimmy Clausen etc. At the end of the day those guys were all succesful college QBs that had an innate ability to process their reads, understand a playbook, and make a decent throw. But the fact they werent throwing it furtherfasterquicker than anyone else meant they were left behind in the NFL. Like, read this scouting report and its almost exactly what people say about Mac.Has good quickness in the pocket to slip around rushers and get rid of the ball. Wont make a lot of deep runs in the open field. Runs mostly erect. Has the incredible ability to complete just about every pass of 15 yards or less. Puts very good touch and zips on his short and intermediate throws. When his deep pass is on, he leads the receiver well. Needs to improve his trajectory on deep throws. His throws tend to come in low on deeper passes. Can throw on the move well and his passes dont lose a lot of velocity. Rarely will you see XXX throw into bad coverage situations. Even when he does, he tends to put the ball only where his receiver can catch it. Intelligently throws away passes instead of passing into coverage or taking a sack. Works through his progressions better than just about any quarterback in college football. This is a display of his excellent football intelligence. Possesses a quick, smooth delivery. Has a slight windup, but its very correctable. Looks to have great balance and control driving back from under center. Quickly gets his feet into position. Clearly most comfortable in fivestep drops.Thats Jimmy Clausen. Elite level mental game. Great mechanics.

1619617204.0	Patriots	Without question I agree with that assessment but Fields may not be there at 15 so its really a question of whether or not it makes sense to trade up to grab him. Im 5050 on that, honestly, as unlike most Im not throwing a hissyfit over having Cam back as a bridge option so Im not taking the attitude that were doomed this year but, obviously, we need a longer term solution. Still, Im not sold on leveraging the farm to grab someone in the first round h*** or high water. A later round pick can always surprise you in practice and Jimmy is likely to come free so theres options here.	585	-0.1791	team	0	gw65l8d	Without question I agree with that assessment but Fields may not be there at 15 so its really a question of whether or not it makes sense to trade up to grab him.

Does that mean he will be Matt Ryan or Drew Brees? No, but he is a much better prospect than people are giving him credit for and coming into the best possible situation in the draft.	685	0.9829	team	0	gw65ndt	Really excited to see how this draft goes and pretty sure its going to be Mac Jones.

Assuming the main reason for teams trading up within or into the top 10 of this class would be to take a QB, could it be possible that people arent so sure as the media makes it out to be, that SF definitely wont take Fields, and thats why ATL is not getting offers?Again, I dont think its the most likely scenario, but I believe its certainly not impossible.	769	0.4404	team	0	gw661kc	Thought about that too.

1619617445.0	Dolphins	At Pick 6 DeVonta Smith, WR, Alabama.  I feel like Smith has fallen in the eyes of many compared to when the college season ended. This is natural, he had just won the Heisman and JaMar Chase was a decent thought in many since the 2019 season had passed. Still  I cant fathom why hes viewed as almost a tier below PittsChase as a pass catcher. I get the weight concerns, they dont bother me whatsoever, but if thats whats holding you up I get it. I feel like Smith is the most assured, guaranteed, highest floor production WR interms of automatically stepping into our offense and likely becoming a consistent 1 WR in terms of receptions and yards. Even moreso than Chase whos highest talents (5050 balls for ex.) is something DVP already excels at. That being said, Im not going to be dogmatic. If Kyle Pitts falls and takes him, Id understand why wed take him. Hes a unicorn and the golden child of this draft aside from the QBs. But... I just cant help but feel despite all the freakish athleticism that his production will be far more dependent on system than other pass catchers, and I think h*** ultimately fall in that TEtier just beneath KittleKelceWaller. As for Chase, I fully expect him to go to Cincinnati   but if he did fall to us, Id understand why wed take him as I dont view him as a bust  just not as much of a sure thing as Smith. Player I Also Wouldnt Mind At 6 Penei Sewell  Listen I get how after looking at so many pass catchers, a line option would seem very dull but Ive liked Sewell more Ive read about him in the last month than any time beforehand. People arent pretending hes Jonathan Ogdentier, but his tape as a 19year old in the PAC12 is as good as it gets, and combining the way he moves with projecting growth  youre getting a franchise Olineman if he stays healthy. I wouldnt love it, but Id get it. Players I Would Hate At Pick 6 Any QB, Jaylen Waddle, Any Defensive Player  This all comes down to value. If we end up trading back, obviously this would change here. Ill comment most about Waddle. I utterly hate the idea of taking a speed WR in the Top 6 picks. I view him as the Henry Ruggs to JeudyCeeDee which is ChaseSmith of this class. I get why hes a valued commodity, but the assumption that even a Tyreek Hill(which would be assuming he hits his potential to a tee, which yanno, doesnt happen for most prospects) just doesnt fly with me. Id be incredibly disappointed if we took him over a more wellrounded WR in Smith. Itd honestly feel like to make taking Kenyan Drake over Derrick Henry to make an apt Alabama playertoplayer comparison. At Pick 18 Ill just be honest. This entirely depends on how the board plays out as you and I have 0 idea what GMs are gonna do. So rather than have a setinstone pick, Ill list a buncha guys I would like. I honestly expect us to make another trade tonight since man... I really dont utterly love any of the players who could fall to here  and Grier makes trades like Phillip Rivers has kids. Players Id Like At Pick 18 Jeremiah OwusuKoramoah (LB, Notre Dame), Najee Harris (RB, Alabama), Zaven Collins (LB, Tulsa), Alijah VerahTucker (T, USC)Explanation Lets start with the defenders. JOK is a stout coverage linebacker and someone I think would fit beautifully in our defense that tries to maximize specific skillsets. He can prolly even cover a number of slot wide receivers with how skilled he is  Im just a fan of that. Zaven Collins is someone some have sliding, but his specific skill when I read the PFF guide of being a fantastic blitzer caught my eye, since the Dolphins generate virtually ALL of their pass rush via the blitz  and that has to deal with I cited none of the edge players here. I love Najee Harris. I feel like hes a lock for a future ProBowler. Would you rather have a future ProBowler at a less valued position in RB or one of the edge guys who has... a... 40 chance of working out? You decide. Finally, VerahTucker is one of the safest projected Olinemen to pan out  not sexy in any way but Id get it.Players I Wouldnt Like At Pick 18 (Kwity Paye, Jayson Oweh, Jaelen Phillips, Azeez Ojulari, Gregory Rousseau) Explanation I dont like any of these Dlinemen. Every one of them has a gigantic flaw in their game. Whether it be Oweh somehow being a physical unicorn and yet failing to record a sack. Phillips injuries  Rousseaus 1year wonder of sacks that dont really hold up to scrutiny. Im not taking a player I dont love in the 1st Round because we have to, we have a need at the position!  when you draft for need in the draft you mess up. I aint interested. One of these dudes with our first 2nd Round pick? Ill consider it since the investment isnt as high anymore. H**** Id be cool if we traded back into the 20s and picked one of them, but sticking at 18 and taking one of them is a nogo in my eyes.	4815	0.9878	team	0	gw662yy	At Pick 6 DeVonta Smith, WR, Alabama.

This naturally leads to watching your WR and waiting to see what happens before deciding and throwing, its their system but it works.I agree that the one area of improvement for Fields is speeding up his processing, but thats something that coaching and repitiion can usually take care of, especially when you have an offensive mind like Shanahan working with him.

I say the Colts would have to package a player instead of picks.My prediction that everyone will surely hate is that the Colts strike a deal with the Eagles trading picks 21, 54 and Darius Leonard for picks 12, 37 and Zach Ertz . At 12 the Colts select Christian Darrisaw. At 37 we take Carlos Basham Jr. My surely flawed reasoning for this trade is that I LOVE Darrisaw. I think Sewell, Slater and Darrisaw are closer to each other than most. However I would be supremely pissed about this trade. It would put a lot of pressure on Ballard to rebuild an already thin position group with late round picks further neglecting other roster needs. However, our Oline would be amazing. Thats my crazy prediction, feel free to question my sanity and virility.	1038	0.9246	team	0	gw66diz	Just for fun I will play the role of the contrarion so we can talk about more than just trading down.

Adding more finger crossing than necessary seems like a risk the Eagles would typically play and then act surprised when the player stays in the medical tent.Honestly, would rather CB in 1st if at all possible Surtain or Horn. Just get a top guy at a position already. The Eagles are rarely in this situation.Still not sure I see Farley escaping r1, but	489	0.1548	team	0	gw66ll8	Its bad to let past results dictate your future, but imo I want nothing to do with an injury prone CB on a team full of question marks.

And he isnt as good an athlete as Levi is. I dont think Barmore is a true 3 technique. He is an inbetween 1 tech and 3 tech but not dominant as either.   Levi is just as strong as Barmore. Even with him being small hes played as a 1 tech and done well. Hes quick off the line and super explosive. He is just a better athlete than Barmore. And he will get bigger when he gets in the pros.   I dont think you base a prospect on sack production.

1619618530.0	Falcons	Its not about wanting the same thing, its being realistic about the draft class. Theres exactly one qb thats going to be reliably better than average in this draft and we arent going to swing a trade with Jacksonville. There are no difference makers at defense in the first 9 picks. I dont know that Dallas can offer enough for us to move back to 10 and hopefully land Surtain. Sewell doesnt fit our line right now, even though he could be slotted out of position and then move if we dont see improvement elsewhere. So its take a huge gamble on a qb (and if you get the qb pick wrong it sets the franchise back 57 years by most estimates), trade back for less than the pick is probably worth to take a defensive player that wont make us any more likely to contend this year (which blows up the whole we wont be picking at the top of the draft again soon argument if we dont win more games), or take a generational talent who is an absolute athletic freak and checks a ton of boxes for what our new coach likes to do. If it isnt Pitts, its full rebuild and well be at the top of the draft again next year.	1104	0.4218	team	0	gw68d4n	Its not about wanting the same thing, its being realistic about the draft class.

But Mond is mocked to go in the 2nd or 3rd in a deep QB class by people who get paid to evaluate these things. That means there is something there. Statistically, hes not going to work out, but realistically, statistically any three out of Lawrence, Smith, Jones, Lance and Fields are also not going to work out either.	394	-0.2263	team	0	gw698z0	Comparing your opinion to mine, I respect that, were two people on Reddit.

Even though Defense is definitely a priority, our oline is the heart of our offense and both Dak and Zekes success depend on those guys and our best ones are getting up there in age. We saw what happened when WFT exposed our weakened oline and with Dak coming off of an injury, we need to protect him at all cost.	394	0.926	team	0	gw699b1	This is why Im not against picking Sewell or Slater at 10 if they are available.

1619618968.0	Bills	Oh, ok.  Im sorry.  I didnt realize we only had one pick this year...Rhetorical question does the Kgun work without Thurman Thomas? He was our 40th pick in the draft, our first that year due our trade the year before for Cornelius Bennett.  Do we get to one or more of those Superbowls without Thurman, the MVP of the NFL his 3rd season? ETN looks like the real deal to me, this generations TT.  I love Erik from Cover 1, but I argue that if our board at 30 is showing our top guys gone, and ETN available, YOU TAKE him.  He alone will cause the defence to have to lay off double coverages from our receivers, making them more dangerous, since now you have home run talents there and now in the backfield.If we really wanted to fortify our line, why bring back Feliciano, who is a turnstile when we play good teams? Dont mean to put him down but we could have done a lot better in FA as to him, now leading us to have to draft an IOL early in the draft.	953	0.9032	team	0	gw69b8x	Oh, ok.  Im sorry.

1619619141.0	49ers	Bruh Romo has elite escapability, you guys are grasping at straws then. If Romo has elite escapability, then Mac Jones does too. Also, winning a ring is particularly hard when Tom Brady (a pocket passer with almost no elite traits) is winning half the super bowls in their careers. And Matt Ryan has been top 10 QB consistently, and Shanahan turned him into the best QB in the league one year. If Matt Ryan is the closest comp to Mac Jones, Im f****** hype.	457	0.9337	team	0	gw69osd	Bruh Romo has elite escapability, you guys are grasping at straws then.

1619619149.0	Bengals	Its not fixing the Oline until these players pan out. If the Bengals pass on Sewell and take two players who end up being really bad on the line, were going to endlessly hear about Burrow getting his knee injured and the team not addressing the problem.	253	-0.6411	team	0	gw69pes	Its not fixing the Oline until these players pan out.

1619619150.0	Seahawks	Hopefully they can use Jamal Adams to get back in this draft and recoup one of those 1st rounders. I dont want them to give him the kind of contract hes surely demanding. Hes the most obvious trade candidate on the roster if they wanted to make a big move for some more picks.	276	0.5389	team	0	gw69pfq	Hopefully they can use Jamal Adams to get back in this draft and recoup one of those 1st rounders.

1619619164.0	Jets	Definitely! Ifwhen the Jets are losing next season, if theyre getting burned because of bad cornerbacks, who cares? If Wilson is progressing, improving, and looking like the guy to lead us in 2022 and beyond, thats all that matters. If instead, our secondary play is solid because we added a top CB talent with an early draft pick, but Wilson is getting rocked every play and getting rattled, then W** was the point? Why did we even draft a quarterback? It would literally be making the same mistakes we made with Darnold, all over again.	538	-0.3361	team	0	gw69qnv	Definitely!

1619619180.0	Eagles	I would. Farley has the size, 4.28s (hand timed) 40, and has only played corner for a few years so he still can get much better. Sidney Jones just had the technique and was actively injured at the time of the draft and teams werent sure if he would even be the same player once he recovered (he wasnt). Farley on the other hand is ready to go and has just as small a risk of injury as anyone else. IMO the reward is worth the risk.	431	0.887	team	0	gw69ruh	I would.

1619619184.0	Bears	Arob on a one year deal probably doesnt help much in the trade. Itd still involve another first rounder i think.	112	-0.3089	team	0	gw69s5f	Arob on a one year deal probably doesnt help much in the trade. Itd still involve another first rounder i think.
