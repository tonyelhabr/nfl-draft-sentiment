1619456516.0	49ers	The 49ers traded up from 12 to 3 with someone in mind. It seems bizarre to me that there would be disagreement because everybody had to be in from the beginning on three QBs, right? Lawrence, Wilson and someone else. Also, I find it weird that anyone in the organization would be in disagreement about what Shanahan wants from HIS quarterback.	343	-0.7906	team	0	gvy6y33	The 49ers traded up from 12 to 3 with someone in mind.

Still have love for him but Im happy I wont have to defend the guy for another season, it was exhausting and made football not fun for me.

But the basis for getting in is so different for those two positions. I dont know Lees career stats off the top of my head but I think he would be a hall of very good player. And tbh as much as I love Jules and unashamedly cried when he retired lmao hes not a HOFer as the standards are now for WR.

Sure, youd love for those guys to have come in and played well immediately, but thats unlikely.

1619456873.0	Broncos	Until we actually pull the trigger on Bridgewater, I am of the mind that the people linking us to him are people who are not in the know, so to speak. People see an available quarterback and a team with a need, so they make up scenarios. But it makes no sense from inside our building to make this move without receiving exceptional compensation. He just doesnt provide a sufficiently obvious and glaring upgrade that we would take the financial risk. (Also, with all the disrespect that flies around here, you are deserving of a little praise. However, when next we meet, we meet as enemies)	592	-0.8397	team	0	gvy7sgz	Until we actually pull the trigger on Bridgewater, I am of the mind that the people linking us to him are people who are not in the know, so to speak.

Do you think there will be any lasting effects realistically if this pick, which by all accounts will be universally disagreed with, doesnt work out?

1619456988.0	Colts	Malik Hooker was the 15th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. S from The Ohio State University. Hooker will be entering his 5th season in the NFL with the previous four all being with the Colts organization. He is currently a free agent as the Colts decline Hookers 5th year option and have yet to resign him. Hooker tore his ACLMCL in the middle of his impressive rookie season and tore his Achilles tendon in week 2 of the 2020 season. Hooker is a ballhawk and when he was drafted, Head Coach Chuck Pagano told him, Youre gonna be our Eddie Reed. A lofty goal for someone that had yet to take a snap. Hooker currently has 124 tackles, 11 pass deflections, and 7 interceptions in 35 career games played. Notes The 2017 draft saw some interesting moves (Bears moving up 1 spot for Mitch Trubisky?).

S from The Ohio State University. Hooker will be entering his 5th season in the NFL with the previous four all being with the Colts organization. He is currently a free agent as the Colts decline Hookers 5th year option and have yet to resign him. Hooker tore his ACLMCL in the middle of his impressive rookie season and tore his Achilles tendon in week 2 of the 2020 season. Hooker is a ballhawk and when he was drafted, Head Coach Chuck Pagano told him, Youre gonna be our Eddie Reed. A lofty goal for someone that had yet to take a snap. Hooker currently has 124 tackles, 11 pass deflections, and 7 interceptions in 35 career games played. Notes The 2017 draft saw some interesting moves (Bears moving up 1 spot for Mitch Trubisky?).

1619457184.0	Buccaneers	No. Two reasons. A veterans are not allowed to be on the practice squad. The purpose of the practice squad is for developing young projects, not stashing veterans to run your practices. B even if we were allowed to, PS players are paid weekly and not by salary. I dont remember the numbers but their max salary is like 200kyr. I also dont remember RGs salary offhand, but its probably around 1milyr. if we underpaid him, he probably finds employment elsewhere.	460	0.5023	team	0	gvy8isg	No. Two reasons.

1619457378.0	Ravens	Marshall has better raw physical attributes, being exactly as fast as Bateman while being taller and playing more physically than Bateman despite being leaner. Watching their tape side by side, theyre clearly different types of receivers, but I see most of Batemans success coming from being schemed wide open against below average college defenses, something that I dont even think Roman has figured out with Marquise yet, meanwhile Marshall has the 1 contested catch percentage while playing against much better defenses and I see less development required with Marshall, a better fit for us in a crowded WR room. And in my viewing experience, Marshalls tape is on a different level than Batemans. His long legs make him look clumsy but hes able to position himself so well between defenders and the quarterback and catches the ball with his hands more frequently than Bateman does while also having a larger catch radius. (Bateman has successfully caught a lot of deep balls with his body but I generally dont like that) Marshall also has more success avoiding first defenders after the catch than Bateman. Bateman has sounded footwork but thats all I can see on tape over Marshall. What do yall like about Bateman over Marshall?	1232	0.9903	team	0	gvy8z5g	Marshall has better raw physical attributes, being exactly as fast as Bateman while being taller and playing more physically than Bateman despite being leaner.

When they announced the pick, and with our draft history, I was a bit stunned but not upset because of the good I had heard about Baker. Risky pick that paid off.

I dont think the Oline is going to be that big of an issue this year. We have 2 pretty good guards, RT is set. Center and LT are the only real question marks and LT can be answered with Banner and Center can be answered in round 2.	366	0.9714	team	0	gvy9aqs	It absolutely is.

1619457521.0	Jets	The only time to trade up in a draft is when there is a massive difference in the players available and the tier of players on your board. I cant imagine there will be a player so high up on the Jets board that falls to the mid early teens that is so far above any players that will be available at 23. Perhaps from 34 to late 20s they make a small move to get ahead of a few teams if there is a highly rated corner, olineman or edge player that falls.	452	0.0	team	0	gvy9bi3	The only time to trade up in a draft is when there is a massive difference in the players available and the tier of players on your board.

1619457535.0	Steelers	We have two RT and no LT. Teven Jenkins is probably my favorite player in the draft but I would be absolutely shocked if we take him. Happy but shocked. No G is going to offer much of an upgrade over Dotson or Decastro, OLB would be depth at a position weve already spent a ton of capital on, ILB is honestly where I see the biggest potential to trade out. People are super high on JOK but he just doesnt fit on our team. We could definitely take Collins or Parsons but none of the other top tier ILBs can play Buck.I agree that most likely they stay at 24 and take BPA, I just think there is a realistic possibility a team wants to trade up for a player we arent interested in, and it could make a lot of sense if we want to prioritize need and take a C or RB	760	0.9399	team	0	gvy9cp7	We have two RT and no LT.

1619457545.0	49ers	Yes and if both reports are correct like you said then it wouldve made sense for the 49ers trade up all the way to 3 if Mac Jones is indeed their guy. You cant take your chances on letting your guy fall all the way to you at 12 or even at 6 if you traded up to that spot, especially if some teams have him ranked as high as QB3 on their draft board and it doesnt matter if most teams have him as QB5 because all it takes is one of those teams that have him as QB3 to jump you and take him.	489	0.5475	team	0	gvy9dka	Yes and if both reports are correct like you said then it wouldve made sense for the 49ers trade up all the way to 3 if Mac Jones is indeed their guy.

1619457569.0	Bengals	Thats true. We will eventually need to draft another long term starter at one position or the other. The reason I like the RT that can play RG approach in the second is because it fills your needs and simultaneously increases your overall depth along the line.Lets say Williams gets injured for the third year in a row, you could move Reiff to LT, move the rookie to RT and then you have XSF as a serviceable back up RG, assuming Spain is your LG starter.If you draft a pure IOL in the 2nd, you dont have that flexibility and youre looking at Fred Johnson at RT in that same scenario. I do think we need to double dip at OL in this draft though because we do have two holes that need to be filled sooner than later. I hope someone like Meinerz, Green or Radunz falls to the 3rd round and we grab them as our depth that could fill that second hole in 2022 or 2023.	863	0.8108	team	0	gvy9fjj	Thats true.

1619457570.0	Eagles	I dont buy that a trade up would be for a CB. If Surtain or Horn are gone, you can still get good value later. Plenty of CBs fit a zone scheme.

1619457580.0	Bills	I also rooted so hard for Manuel. I thought the Bills had outsmarted the entirety of math with this pick, but that would have to wait for a future date. One thing that is obvious as I watched those highlights, a LOT of those 10 yard throws were wide open receivers on obvious blown coverage. When you watch Josh (from 2020 at least) you see throws that if the ball was off by 1 foot it would be an incomplete or an interception, and he often does it while on the move. Wouldve liked to see EJ succeed, but thank God thats all behind us now and were not worrying about a QB in this draft.	587	0.9434	team	0	gvy9git	I also rooted so hard for Manuel.
