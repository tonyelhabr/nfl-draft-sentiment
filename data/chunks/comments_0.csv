1619813303.0	Redskins	How has it skewed my opinion? You dont know how high anyone had the dude rated, just like I dont.  I even said we have no way of knowing. Im not happy with the pick because its a LB. But, Im not bashing the team because I hope he plays lights out. Both things can be true, I can dislike the pick, and still root for the kid.	324	0.7004	team	0	gwgqzb2	How has it skewed my opinion?

1619813319.0	Bears	Ive been on the train since 2001 and know why you feel this way. I was teetering on the edge of the abyss you rightfully fell into all season. I was down on the Bears this year, more than ever in my life.But this franchise has never had a QB like this guy. Weve failed all these years because our guys have been Grossman, Cutler and Trubisky. None of them are the same caliber Fields is. That means a lot. Just maybe it will work out this time, because this is the first time I dont need to convince myself against my own wisdom that it will.	542	0.2168	team	0	gwgr0je	Ive been on the train since 2001 and know why you feel this way.

Youll notice on tape Georgia dbs dont really play the ball, they watch the hands of the receiver and try to punch through the catch.	421	0.4248	team	0	gwgr0te	Georgia fan here.

I had seen Jaycee play and the crazy measurables but this is the first interview format I really got the chance to see him in and he seems like a really smart humble kid. He was really paying attention and looking to learn from a GOAT right there when he spoke and you love to f***** see it. The sky is the limit for that young man with his athleticism.	508	0.9833	team	0	gwgr2hd	I was worried at first but this turned out pretty good once I got to watch the whole thing.
