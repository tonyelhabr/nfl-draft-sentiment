1619826778.0	Jets	I would love if they kept him. I am not familiar with what he is costing to keep him. But if the Jets do retain him, I would be pumped.I also recognize JD is rebuilding this team from the ground up with young talent and aspirations. Crowder is a crafty vet. If he can go somewhere to compete for a SB I would like that just as much as if the Jets keep him. I would personally prefer to get draft picks for him but if we can keep him that is just a plus. A good situation either way unless they just release him.	511	0.9246	team	0	gwhifh9	I would love if they kept him. I am not familiar with what he is costing to keep him.

1619826782.0	Packers	He can also be reasonably expected to play just as well or at least nearly as well as he did the past year, for the next 2 years or so. He has pulled the Green Bay cart along for the past 7 or 8 years now with little help. He does have leverage when it comes to the fanbase and the interest of the team. Maybe not contractural leverage, but the Packers could easily get another championship with him leading. And hes also a legitimate finalist option to be the permanent host of Jeopardy. Which is a much sweeter gig than what the Packers and the NFL is offering him right now. Every single year he could sustain a serious andor permanent injury. He deserves guaranteed money for carrying the team, too. Despite all of this, I also dont think this is a leverage play. Heres my thoughts on all of this1. Its overblown b******** He vented some frustrations and it was blown out of proportion. 2. It was released conveniently hours before the draft. 3. Everyone already knew that Rodgers had to be frustrated with how the F.O. has been handling things for awhile now. Its just being said aloud now. The Jordan Love pick was the dumbest thing that an NFL team has done in the past 2 years (excluding the Texans of course). 4. Rodgers addresses these things in person, and has indicated many dozens of times in the past few years that he hates the media for literally this exact type of s**** I wont be worried until Rodgers says something himself. Paraphrased heard it from someone I know headlines dont wow me anymore.	1515	-0.9624	team	0	gwhifrx	He can also be reasonably expected to play just as well or at least nearly as well as he did the past year, for the next 2 years or so.

1619826887.0	Eagles	Opinion The first thing people will say is Injuries, well, he was injured and he went back in. Look past the red flag for a sec and see the player, mans a beast. x200BAnalysis Tough, physical center with very good size. Plays very smart football, and did very well keeping up with the rest of the big guys on the OL for Alabama. Drives and attacks his opponents, finishes, and will easily crash and hit 23 defenders. For someone of his size, he has fast feet and keeps his feet moving. Shows excellent technique, fundamentally sound, good anchor against bull rushes, and keeps a good bend in his knees.  He is coming off a torn ACL, that along with having shorter arms for the ideal center makes means that some may see him as having some skill set limitations. His major red flags will be the injury concerns, 2016 he had a Knee Injury that ended his season. In 2017 another undisclosed injury took him out of the season. In 2018 he played 1 game before ending an Ankle Injury took him out. He was medically redshirted for the 2019 season and played in 2020, ending the SEC championship game vs Florida with an ACL.   Opinion Landon Dickerson will need to show he can stay healthy for a season, luckily, the Eagles will not ask him to come in day 1. He can work on his technique with Kelce, getting better at run blocking while polishing up his pass protection. His injuries are a concern but I have high hopes for him.	1420	0.9256	team	0	gwhin9j	Opinion The first thing people will say is Injuries, well, he was injured and he went back in.

1619827191.0	Lions	Heres The Ringers scouting report. They have him as the 37th player overall Onwuzurike is a tall, athletic defensive lineman with massive legs and long, powerful arms. The Washington stars sudden first step and overall core strength are the first things that jump off the tape he shoots out of his stance and generates incredible torque when locked up with opponents, wrenching offensive linemen off their feetsometimes even tossing them out of the way. Hes undersized, but capable of taking on doubleteams, and hes tall, yet able to play with sumo wrestler leverage. He gets low, gets inside opponents pads, and controls reps, leaning on swim and pullrip moves to get into the pocket. He never stops working his hands, clubbing away at opponents even when locked into doubleteams. Hes a pocketcollapser who can get skinny and slice through the line and into the backfield. And his feet are like pistons, constantly firing to power his bull rush. Onwuzurike frequently played nose tackle at Washington but could fit best as a threetechnique or fivetechnique in the pros. Against the run, Onwuzurike does a good job of stacking offensive linemen while keeping his eyes in the backfield. He strings out runs while holding the line, and shows awareness of screens and hustles to run the play down. He can be a bit undisciplined and crude in his passrush plan at times, and runs into and ricochets bounces off opponents and his own teammates on some plays. Hes inconsistent, and when his first move doesnt work, he too often gets stalemated by his opponent. Onwuzurike opted out of the 2020 season but won firstteam AllPac12 honors in 2019, totaling six tackles for a loss and 2.0 sacks. He notched another 6.5 TFL and 3.0 sacks in 2018.WHY HE COULD RISEOnwuzurike has a rare combination of firststep explosiveness, body control, and power. Hes a versatile defensive lineman who can play on three downs.WHY HE COULD FALLHis production hasnt yet matched his potential. He needs to continue to develop a stronger arsenal of moves as a pass rusher.	2041	0.9867	team	0	gwhj8hd	Heres The Ringers scouting report. They have him as the 37th player overall Onwuzurike is a tall, athletic defensive lineman with massive legs and long, powerful arms. The Washington stars sudden first step and overall core strength are the first things that jump off the tape he shoots out of his stance and generates incredible torque when locked up with opponents, wrenching offensive linemen off their feetsometimes even tossing them out of the way. Hes undersized, but capable of taking on doubleteams, and hes tall, yet able to play with sumo wrestler leverage. He gets low, gets inside opponents pads, and controls reps, leaning on swim and pullrip moves to get into the pocket. He never stops working his hands, clubbing away at opponents even when locked into doubleteams. Hes a pocketcollapser who can get skinny and slice through the line and into the backfield. And his feet are like pistons, constantly firing to power his bull rush. Onwuzurike frequently played nose tackle at Washington but could fit best as a threetechnique or fivetechnique in the pros. Against the run, Onwuzurike does a good job of stacking offensive linemen while keeping his eyes in the backfield. He strings out runs while holding the line, and shows awareness of screens and hustles to run the play down. He can be a bit undisciplined and crude in his passrush plan at times, and runs into and ricochets bounces off opponents and his own teammates on some plays. Hes inconsistent, and when his first move doesnt work, he too often gets stalemated by his opponent. Onwuzurike opted out of the 2020 season but won firstteam AllPac12 honors in 2019, totaling six tackles for a loss and 2.0 sacks. He notched another 6.5 TFL and 3.0 sacks in 2018.WHY HE COULD RISEOnwuzurike has a rare combination of firststep explosiveness, body control, and power. Hes a versatile defensive lineman who can play on three downs.WHY HE COULD FALLHis production hasnt yet matched his potential. He needs to continue to develop a stronger arsenal of moves as a pass rusher.

And we all know that ACLs in 2021 are generally not nearly as careerderailing(even for OLmobile QBsetc. who depend more heavily on those ligaments) as they were even 20 years ago.  Assuming that his knee is coming along fine(please god tell me the FO went out and got independent medical opinions and didnt just go with those of their own team doctors lol), this dude could be a serious mauler and a fixture on our OLine for the next 810 y********* it, Im good with this pick.  2.05 is frankly a bit too high to reach for ASJ, StokesCampbell were both gone, and I dunno what the actual f*** is happening with JOK right now.

1619827224.0	Lions	I did this last year and the year before, and it worked just fine.  So unless it has changed since last year, this should still work. There was even a browser extension for Chrome that spoofs your GPS location for the browser itself.  This is what they use to determine your location for broadcasts for local games.  So I just used the browser extension to change my location to Detroit, refresh YTTV, and then it would think I was really in Detroit watching.  By doing it that way, I didnt have to change my location back at any point in time since it wasnt traveling.  Additionally, doing it this way with the GPS spoof, it would let me change to other markets if there was a different game on that I wanted to watch or if game was blacked out or, if there was no (or a bad) game in the 4pm slot for example.  I remember there being no 4pm game one weekend in my viewing location so I just changed it to LA, refreshed, and saw what options were available there.  Closest thing I had to Sunday Ticket, though it did have extra steps with the browser extension and setting locations.  This method also worked for other sports too, which is a plus.	1147	-0.7269	team	0	gwhjat7	I did this last year and the year before, and it worked just fine.

1619827228.0	Eagles	I think there is a balance to it.       Smith I think is an adequate risk to take as there is a lot to look at and bet on. Dickerson is a phenomenal player. I know some wont like this pick because we are good at developing and coaching OL and we have other great needs, but he can be a real difference maker. Im in favor of the pick but his risk is considerable. I believe he finished each of the last 3 seasons hurt. Makes me nervous but I absolutely love the player.	468	0.5768	team	0	gwhjb22	I think there is a balance to it.       Smith I think is an adequate risk to take as there is a lot to look at and bet on.

1619827229.0	Giants	Doesnt necessarily mean he has a low opinion of the draft. Its very possible they have mid2nd round grades on a lot of players and they felt that the value dropoff from 4250 was outweighed by the value gained from the swap.   They wouldnt trade back if there wasnt a player on their board graded around 50. Same as Toney, Im certain they had a midfirst round grade on him and knew he wouldnt last long after 20. The picks may not all hit but I trust were making good decisions based on how our board is ranked.	510	0.91	team	0	gwhjb4l	Doesnt necessarily mean he has a low opinion of the draft.

I think him playing in a 2back system at UNC didnt give him the spotlight like Harris or ETN got. But many scouts thought he was the best back in the draft. His tape shows that.	322	0.9439	team	0	gwhjksh	ACC is a Power 5 conference. Might not be the SEC (but the SEC kinda got exposed by their own conference this year). I think hes just that good.

The point values for young, mid to highpotential QBs were insane enough that offering one 77 overall 3 star QB (3050,000 points) could net you 3 first rounders (11 K each) or two entire drafts. So youd trade for a bunch of picks, draft a QB with like 13 of them and then flip those QBs for more picks. You could easily wind up with all 32 first round picks after enough time haha.

Rodgers also sees the writing on the wall with the draft pick and was in the same situation with Farve.  Pretty much he is gone unless they either Trade Jordan Love or offer him an extension that will guarantee he is the QB for at least 4 more years  matching the contract of Jordan Love.	480	0.9246	team	0	gwhjxxl	When Brady found out Belichick tried to trade him.

1619827575.0	Lions	From Bob McGinns ranking of DTs.  Its a weak class for sure. Hes a movementoriented guy who plays (hard), said one scout. Im not sure he isnt a better player than Barmore. Hes the guy Im most excited about.Redshirted in 2016, subbed in 17, started four games in 18, started 12 games in 19 and opted out in 20.Undersized guy who tries to rely on being an athlete and plays in gaps, said another scout. But hes not that talented to be that kind of guy. He had like two sacks in the Pac12 for a guy whos supposed to be a pass rusher.Finished with 95 tackles (16 for loss) and seven sacks.I have a bias against undersized guys that dont play big at the point of attack, a third scout said. Its such a big mans game.Managed 29 reps on the bench press.(I) like him, a fourth scout said. He gets off the ball. He is an attackingstyle player. He is a leader. He works hard. He had an Achilles injury in high school, but hes been able to manage through that. Got good closing speed. He can pressure the quarterback from all different angles. Probably likeTyrone Crawford.Helped his high school team in Allen, Texas, win three state titles. Showed up at the Senior Bowl, practiced one day, remained in Mobile (Ala.) all week but didnt practice again.It was disappointing, a fifth scout said of his brief stint in Mobile. Just expected more.	1330	-0.8589	team	0	gwhk04f	From Bob McGinns ranking of DTs.  Its a weak class for sure. Hes a movementoriented guy who plays (hard), said one scout.

Everyone thought Ju Ju was great til he lost Antonio Brown and then he became nearly irrelevant.   Besides them only two of those mentioned were taken in the last 5 years and one, Cooper, is already on his 2nd team and he was considered replaceable.	472	0.8271	team	0	gwhk4if	The list of 1st rd underwhelming or outright busts dwarfs the list you just made.

He has good upperbody strength and the violent hands to disengage from blocks. Onwuzurike locates the ball quickly and closes well for an interior defensive lineman.

Javonte is from my hometown and high school, and many who have watched young men play Bulldog football over the years, there was a consensus that Javonte was one of, if not the best football players theyve ever seen. His coach made local news because he felt Javonte was being overlooked because he came from a small school. We may have 800 students in all 4 grades. Javonte had hardly any interest from recruiters. In his 4th straight State Championship game appearance, he ripped off a 75 yard run around the right side. The game was held at Kenan Stadium (UNC campus) and thenhead coach Larry Fedora was in his football office and took notice. Javonte went on to have a 23 td game and 100 yards. Fedora invited him on an official visit the following day, to which he offered Javonte, and he accepted. Javontes dream was to one day play at Carolina. Had he not been offered, he would have gotten in on his own as he was the class valedictorian.He is a punishing runner that just wont go down. So you guys got a phenomenal player on and off the field.	1084	0.7471	team	0	gwhl0nf	You guys got a phenomenal pick.

Of course, id be very very surprised to see him make the same jump Allen did. But im in the camp that he still hasnt got a fair shake to show if hes got it or not. Everybody would be screaming for Patons head if he trades Drew and Drew ends up having a great season. Theres too much talent and unseen potential on Lock to call it quits.You look at Locks collegiate past and you can see hes not injury prone, hes had two freak injuries in the NFL. If the Broncos had passed on Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson or Trey Lance id be infuriated. You dont draft a guy you dont like, such as Fields or McCorkle Jones.

1619828144.0	Cowboys	From Dane Bruglers draft guidethere are character red flags due to youthful immaturity and accountability issues (on and off the field)...some of his former coaches go to bat for him, but some dont (he needs to grow up, according to one former coach)...scouts say his rapping passion might supersede his football passion (has released six albums under the name YKDV Bossman Fat)...suspended for the 2018 bowl game for a violation of team rules...he had one foot out the door before the season was over and the coaches directed him to opt out.Overall, Joseph wont be a fit for every organization due to maturity concerns, but he has firstround physical talent and the athleticism to blanket any type of receiver, which is why a team will likely roll the dice on him in the top50 picks.Sounds very high risk high reward. If someone in the locker room or coaching staff can whip some sense into him, he has the physical gifts to be a stud. Otherwise he just becomes a walking character concern.	991	0.8544	team	0	gwhl46x	From Dane Bruglers draft guidethere are character red flags due to youthful immaturity and accountability issues (on and off the field)...some of his former coaches go to bat for him, but some dont (he needs to grow up, according to one former coach)...scouts say his rapping passion might supersede his football passion (has released six albums under the name YKDV Bossman Fat)...suspended for the 2018 bowl game for a violation of team rules...he had one foot out the door before the season was over and the coaches directed him to opt out.Overall, Joseph wont be a fit for every organization due to maturity concerns, but he has firstround physical talent and the athleticism to blanket any type of receiver, which is why a team will likely roll the dice on him in the top50 picks.Sounds very high risk high reward.

1619828434.0	Packers	Your other post was spot on but this is off.  Gute would absolutely look dumber not sticking by his HOF QB who just won an MVP.  Even if he s**** next year (which he wont), Rodgers has earned the right to maybe have the team carry him a year or two instead of the other way around.  He carried McCarthys outdated scheme and Teds mediocre drafting at the end for over half a decade.Remember, Rodgers has always outplayed his contract.  Even when he was the highest paid QB in the league (only for a year or two each time, he was also the best or among the best QBs in the league in terms of wins above replacment.  Hes been so good, he kept McCarthy employed along with Capers when their failures wouldve been manifest years earlier with any other qb and organization.Which makes your post saying no team will want him s******  Half the organizations in the league would go all in and mortgage their future for the current NFL MVP.  We know this because the Rams offered more for Rosgers than they did Stafford.  The Packers fanbase is so spoiled being perennially good.  They dont understand how any other fanbase except maybe the Pats would be willing to risk even 20 years of sucking to go after a ring now.  No Saints fan regrets going allin on Drew Brees and they didnt even win a ring.Rodgers probably wants this level of commitment.  I personally say we give it to him its the besr chance we have of getting another super bowl.  The Packers though probably want to keep their options open.  They want to seewhat they have in Love this season and move on from Rodgers in 1 or 2 years if Love shows any promise.  Being consistently good is better in their eyes than going allin.  The sticking point probably is the Packers want the option to move on to Love within 2 years while Rodgers wants a longer defacto commitment in terms of guaranteed money.	1854	0.9941	team	0	gwhlogs	Your other post was spot on but this is off.

1619828463.0	49ers	I think Lance will be successful because he is so willing to take the extra step. Its one thing to be smart, Fitzpatrick was really smart, but understanding scheme and making good decisions dont really work together. There are plenty of quarterbacks that are really smart, but make bad decisions, or dont see something in the play. The bigger thing is Lances maturity and willingness to go all in, with everything. He wasnt able to play last season, so he was watching tape to understand NFL defenses. If he didnt understand something, he asked the right questions and would routinely ask coaches to stay and work with him, so he could be as prepared as possible. You are putting together Shanahan and Lance, two people who strive for perfection, and expect nothing less. If Shanahan has a full season to teach Lance what he is looking at and work on his accuracy, Lance is going to be someone who will be very special. Only thing I see being a learning curve is Shanahan wanting Lance to use his legs, but always be looking downfield. Mahomes and Wilson are as great as they are because if they escape, they arent looking for the 5 yards with their legs, they are looking for 30 yards downfield after the corner has lost his wide receiver.	1240	0.979	team	0	gwhlqiz	I think Lance will be successful because he is so willing to take the extra step.

He can create momentum with his size as a run blocker, but hes not a great bender and lacks explosiveness into contact. Pass protection will get a little choppy against athletic interior rushers and twist games that force him to make quick slides to cut off his edges, but he has the anchor to stall bull rushers all day long.

Are some of our players better than they played under Patricias garbage scheme? Can any turn into starters under Glenn? Id rather wait another pick to help answer the QB question than start filling holes on defense.

If you watch the NFC title game you should realize that the packers receiving corp couldnt get separation faster than the O line could hold a block or just flat out dropped passes which caused them to stall on some key drives. So yeah drafting QB, backup RB and full back with your first three picks surely didnt help with that. If Jordan Love isnt a top 5 QB one day this draft will probably be considered one of the worst in recent memory. Adding a real number 2  WR would help the offense a lot against teams with depth in their secondary the type you meet in the playoffs. Eric Stokes according to most analysts was a big reach hope he pans out and isnt Kevin King 2.0	760	0.7591	team	0	gwhm5hg	What a laughable take.

1619828759.0	Packers	Love was stuck as the 3rd QB because he had no offseason, no preseason. Theres simply no way he could start an NFL game unless absolutely necessary. With ARod and Tim Boyle, it wasnt absolutely necessary. Its a simple as that. When they drafted Rashan Gary, they didnt need him to start either because they had talent in place that he could learn under. Thats the way a good organization committed to longterm success operates, so I dont really understand what youre trying to say in your second point. Your third point is just plain lazy. The Buccaneers were awful for many many years and reaped high draft picks and stocked their front 7 with high first and second round picks. Theyre awesome up front. Thats the timetested way to win a SB in the NFL. Its not as if Tom Brady won that NFCCG or the SB. It was that front 7. The Buccaneers had tons of cap room due to years of futility too, so they could easily afford to sign Brady, Gronk, etc., etc. By contrast, the Packers have been really good to great for over a decade. They have one of the highest paid players in the league at QB, Edge, LT,  RB. At worst the Pack were 691 in 2018, which netted them the 12th pick overall (which they spent on Gary another guy that didnt help them right away). The last time they even picked in the top 10 was 2009. Tampa Bay on the other hand have picked in the top 10 overall 5 of the last 10 years (along with an 11th and 12th in the other half decade so 7 out of the last 10 years, TB has picked no lower than 12th). Tampa Bay has been in full rebuild mode for years and had the ability to do what the Packers simply cannot do without blowing the whole team up. Yes, the packers traded up to draft whom they determined to be ARods heir apparent. They gave up a 4th round draft pick to move up a whole 4 spots from 30th to 26th. Wow, soooo crazy. Almost like the spent a first round draft pick on a wild kid with a cannon arm in 1992 or another potential heir apparent in 2005. And take it from a person who recalls well each of those prior gambles, most folks moaned and wailed until they got surprisingly silent when it all worked out very well. I respect your right to your opinion, but I just dont understand what the h*** you (and those agree with you) are talking about.	2271	0.9598	team	0	gwhmbgt	Love was stuck as the 3rd QB because he had no offseason, no preseason.

1619828848.0	Jaguars	Ill say some more in 2017, his first year, he started at LT as a true freshman, the first Stanford player to do so since 2000. This is not easy since Stanfords offense relies on the offensive line to do a lot of different types of things in the power running game. Despite our line being terrible and not working together at all, he was still the co pac12 freshman of the year. In 2018, he balled out. The line improved and Walker just destroyed people. Particularly, the line was much better in pa** pro as a whole, but walker did great work to keep KJ Costello upright when he went the second most season pa**ing yards in school history.He made allpac 12 first team and was going to be a top 10 pick, but he literally couldnt declare for the draft because he was a sophomore. The next year he suffered an unfortunate injury in the first game and decided to return for a final year for a variety of reasons. Had he declared in 2019, barring injury, he would have gone alongside Bechton and Wills, and all of those other tackles people are upset we dont have. As it stands he opted out due to COVID and worked his a** off to come back in just as good if not better shape than he left in. Thats what you should know about this guy. He probably needs one year but thankfully, we werent drafting an LT for need. This guy could be a franchise dude.	1344	-0.9373	team	0	gwhmhox	Ill say some more in 2017, his first year, he started at LT as a true freshman, the first Stanford player to do so since 2000.

Those types of coaches are unicorns, so forgive me if Im very skeptical about Smiths plans for the offense.Regardless, even if he truly intends to do this, and he swaps out his 12 package for a l****** more open offense, we need an RB. But why would you deviate from that 12 package, when you just drafted another TE. That tells me hes going to continue running that package, and if thats the case, he needs a RB whos going to move the pile.

1619828966.0	49ers	Aaron Banks projects to the NFL as a quality option along an offensive line. Banks, who is a multiyear starter with the Irish, brings plenty of experience to the pro game and is physically built to last on the interior. Banks offers a wide base, plenty of weight distribution below the waist, and some notable results as a power at the point of attack blocker looking to drive opponents off the line of scrimmage. Banks game is not without flaws and his projection will not be a universal oneteams that ask their interior line to play out in space often or play laterally to string out action will find Banks resume much less appealing than those that implement vertical climbs and double teams to generate interior lanes and space. The Irish guard does have starter potential although I would consider his ceiling to be that of a midlevel starter at the pro level and only in specific systems that dont bank too heavily on zone concepts.	938	-0.3182	team	0	gwhmpsy	Aaron Banks projects to the NFL as a quality option along an offensive line.

1619829107.0	Chiefs	This is true, and I know many want us to find a diamond in the rough for WR2, but I think our receiving core will be just fine now defenses (should) have to respect the run game again. Kelce eating them up short with a solid run game means no more dime and nickel looks all game with 2 high safeties. Defenses will have to actually think against KC again. Granted, while scheming against KC WAS simple the past couple years, it doesnt matter because most teams lack the personnel to properly stop us.	500	0.8431	team	0	gwhmzkz	This is true, and I know many want us to find a diamond in the rough for WR2, but I think our receiving core will be just fine now defenses (should) have to respect the run game again.
