1619829211.0	Eagles	Hurts and Smith. Dont get me wrong, Both Tua and Waddle are great. But if you look at who received Tuas TD throws the most, it would be Smith. Tua could prove me wrong, but I dont think Tua is as good as Hurts can be. Hurts can throw the ball and rush the ball. He isnt just a throw heavy guy. Tua has also had a bit of luck with his college on not being intercepted more, because he throws a lot of long passes, hoping for something good.Hurts sees the field well and has shown he can read what the best options are. With Waddle, he had some horrible luck with injuries at Bama and he had elite doctors and staff there. What happens if he gets nailed by defenders who are bigger, faster and stronger than college players are? Maybe he holds it together, but its a gamble.So to finish this, Jalen Hurts and Devonta Smith. Hurts had substantial success with two different programs and Smith, well, he is the Heisman winner for a reason.	935	0.9624	team	0	gwhn6qt	Hurts and Smith.

1619829359.0	Bengals	Yes. I coach DBs and have coached for a lot of years.  My question to you would be do you know what a defense does when they know an OLine s*****  See a deep route takes time regardless of who is running it.  Its really not hard for a DB to cover something deep if they know whats going on.  Its also really hard to throw deep if your QB cant drop back and set to throw that deep ball.  Sooooo... Lets break this down.  Teams will GLADLY put coverage in question a little if they dont think teams can stop their blitz effectively. So say they rush 6 but know it will be effective.  Most teams (if youve watched as of recent) will play tight coverage knowing our QB only has say 34 seconds to throw and high probability they will need to scramble.  That tight coveraged means the timing of a deep route is now disrupted and hurt.  The quick throw is much tougher (which is now needed) and so now we just have a hope and prayer our QB scrambles and makes something happens, which eventually just results in said QB taking hits and less plays being made.  So please... When you make a s***** comment assuming I dont understand things, at least explain what YOU think.  OL is far more important than Elite WRs	1205	0.9133	team	0	gwhnh8n	Yes.

1619829530.0	Cowboys	I would argue that their drafting record isnt as great as it seems. They get points for Dak, Zack, DLaw, and Gallup. Zeke was obvious. They traded for coop. Lamb looks good but its too early to tell on him, Diggs, Gallimore. We used our top pick this year to replace either our top pick from a few years ago who is made of paper or our 2nd round pick who redshirted a full year and flashed before bottoming out. Connor Williams looks average at best. Lewis, Brown, Wilson are serviceable at best. Im the top two picks this year both have huge character concerns just days after a press conference where they praised Sean Lees leadership and talked about how they need his type of character and build the right culture. This is a f****** joke.	742	0.9814	team	0	gwhnsxg	I would argue that their drafting record isnt as great as it seems. They get points for Dak, Zack, DLaw, and Gallup. Zeke was obvious. They traded for coop. Lamb looks good but its too early to tell on him, Diggs, Gallimore. We used our top pick this year to replace either our top pick from a few years ago who is made of paper or our 2nd round pick who redshirted a full year and flashed before bottoming out. Connor Williams looks average at best. Lewis, Brown, Wilson are serviceable at best. Im the top two picks this year both have huge character concerns just days after a press conference where they praised Sean Lees leadership and talked about how they need his type of character and build the right culture. This is a fucking joke.

1619829531.0	Panthers	Its the best way to do the draft. A lot of the draft is a c*** shoot and guessing. Getting more guesses gives you a chance to get more right. Its also the cheapest way to add talent too as rookie contracts are a lot cheaper. I love the moves. Unless you absolutely want someone who is there like Horn whos easily CB1 for me...then move back. Gets more assets.	359	0.9402	team	0	gwhnt15	Its the best way to do the draft. A lot of the draft is a crap shoot and guessing. Getting more guesses gives you a chance to get more right.

He was a right tackle in high school and as a freshman for the Longhorns before moving to the left side in 2019 and producing two years of ascending play and consistent results. Cosmi blocks with quickness and urgency in pass protection, usually marrying his eyes with his hands and base to stay square. He will give ground vs. power but uses sinkandsettle to recover and relies on his posture to create leverage. Overall, Cosmi lacks overwhelming sizepower traits, but he wins with lateral positioning and strong hands to cover up edge speed and execute in the run game. He projects as a solid NFL starter.GRADE 2nd Round (No. 38 overall)	2074	0.9206	team	0	gwhnx58	STRENGTHS Fires out of his stance and quickly sets up shop to answer rushers...aboveaverage foot quickness, knee bend and movement patterns...keeps his eyes and hands on the same wavelength...sits in his passsets to attack power with leverage...chops down the hands of rushers and looks to finish...makes quick adjustments and not easily fooled by blitzesstunts...able to create movement in the run game on down blocks...steady at the second level...was only 215 pounds as a high school sophomore and devoted himself to the weight room (former Texas strength coach Yancy McKnight describes Cosmi as a freak)...voted a team captain in 2020...started 34 straight games over three seasons, spending time at both left and right tackle.WEAKNESSES Doesnt have elite arm length...plays quick, but not fluid...adequate play strength, but can be bumped when rushers reach his edge...occasionally late with his passset mechanics, allowing rushers to reach his chest when his hands are offschedule...flashes violence as a finisher, but needs to be more consistent in this area...needs to improve his anchor strength to better halt power rushers...gets himself in trouble when his pads rise, allowing edge quickness underneath him... inconsistent body control as a run blocker...might struggle to drive NFL defenders from their spot.SUMMARY A threeyear starter at Texas, Cosmi manned the left tackle spot in former head coach Tom Hermans offense.

1619829737.0	Ravens	Tyre will be better with a real offseason and hopefully good health this time around. Not sure why some are so quick to bail on rookies with upside. Either way, EDC will sign a solid vet RT shortly for competition.I hope Bozeman stays at LG, where he played very well. Top 10 in pass block and run block win rates amongst all NFL guards. Why create two questionmarks by moving him to C and hoping to find a LG?Mekari will be better too. I know he struggled in the Buffalo game, but that was his worst performance in all his games played. Its too easy to just look at that and call him done, and its not representative of his body of work. He should go into camp as part of the conversation at C with TCC and maybe a vet or draft pick.LT Stanley, LG Bozeman, and RG Zeitler should be etched in stone for this fall barring injury. Three really good pieces to the puzzle.	868	0.846	team	0	gwho7q0	Tyre will be better with a real offseason and hopefully good health this time around.

1619829738.0	Panthers	Generally speaking, I love trading down. I think its great process and indicative of a wellrun team. Especially in a situation where they have less information about these players than ever because of the pandemic season and no combine, I think giving yourself 4 darts to throw at the board in day 2 is pretty awesome. A lot of players I really like are coming off the board, though, naturally. I do worry we misjudged the first trade back and didnt think Cosmi would get grabbed. Radunz now off the board, too, and Im worried weve missed out on the tackles worth taking.	571	0.9348	team	0	gwho7v1	Generally speaking, I love trading down.

1619829780.0	Jaguars	There is only one FS on the field at a time, yes. I dont know if you know this, but the FS and SS roles are very different. Most players who are really good at one, arent so good at the other. No SS in this draft is worth a 1st or 2nd, and we were never going to take a FS as the starter there is set in stone. There was no starting safety we needed available so far that is worth it. You cant address a position when no players at that position are available. And DL has nothing to do with what I said, you just wanted to rant some more I guess.	546	-0.8272	team	0	gwhoari	There is only one FS on the field at a time, yes.

1619829828.0	Bengals	Sewell is overrated. Trex arms, sloppy technique, poor balance, and rarely played against NFL caliber players. Massive reach at 5 overall..Arms are less than ideal length, weak conference, not nearly as athletic as you are implying. He also played in an ultra quick release spread offense so his pass blocking at the NFL level is completely unproven. Someone like Leatherwood in the second, who is a better athlete, with better measurables, and has 4 years experience starting experience in a better conference would be better value imo.Take someone worthy of the spot like Chase or Pitts, or trade down and take whoever falls between Slater, Leatherwood and Sewell. Leatherwood is the only first round projected tackle without Trex arms. uCheesiecake on Sewell.Carman has an inch less on his arms so where does that put him on the Trex arms scale? His measurables are undersized even for a Guard. Seems like you should hate this pick from your measurables view point?	968	0.9331	team	0	gwhoe41	Sewell is overrated.

It doesnt get more important than the trenches, iOL is an urgent need, and he is a potential AllPro.

1619830072.0	Titans	Its not a sexy spot and its unfortunate that they had to address this position so early when you expected last years first round pick to address it. For those of you upset...do any of us really know anything about any of these picks for any team? We attach ourselves to certain players for a variety of reasons but no one truly knows how guys will pan out.Did anyone think Nate Davis would ultimately receive an AllPro vote in his second season playing? Keith Carter has ultimately proven to be a really good OL coach, Ill trust him with this guy (assuming this guy isnt a head case like a certain former first rounder...) and hope he develops him as well as he has Davis.	672	0.9145	team	0	gwhouxl	Its not a sexy spot and its unfortunate that they had to address this position so early when you expected last years first round pick to address it.

Like youre clearly a knucklehead, why should I trust your word on more severe incidents?I hope the locker room stuff is untrue and nothing else ever comes up.

1619830522.0	Eagles	Im sorry but your logic is very faulty.I understand all that but we have traded for or signed plenty of great offensive linemanDoesnt matterwhich is a smart position to sign since they arent paid as much as other positions, especially centersguards. OT are the 2nd highest paid position bro. Centers and guards are paid much less than them, but this still doesnt make sense because by your same logic, if Dickerson pans out, we can sign him in the future for cheaper than other positions. Thus making this an excellent long term investment.Meanwhile its smarter to draft and keep on the cheap positions like QB and WR. W** are you talking about this is literally not true. Rookies get paid based on their draft position, not their position.Plus Olinemen that we sign usually are sure things while drafted players take years to be goodLane Johnson was good immediately and so was Kelce pretty much. Seumalo and Vaitai both developed in 23 years. Dillard has been injured. Mailata was a rugby player. The only OL weve really signed recently are Peters as a bandaid, Wisniewski who was average at best, and Brooks, who was great.	1126	0.9856	team	0	gwhpq9x	Im sorry but your logic is very faulty.I understand all that but we have traded for or signed plenty of great offensive linemanDoesnt matterwhich is a smart position to sign since they arent paid as much as other positions, especially centersguards.

Someone wrote an article on this when we traded for Trent citing Shannahan offenses favoring light offensive linemen but they had to be strong. Dont recall who it was. They look for that type of linemen (see Alex Mack at center, Brunskill). Theyll go heavy in the guard position if the guard has fast feet because they can teach the technique even if the guy is a heavy linemen (315). Prototype players.

1619830712.0	Packers	This wasnt about competition though. This was about getting a replacement within the next few years for Aaron Rodgers, one of the greatest QBs of all time, who can still play, instead of getting a skill player.And I think you need to get that stick out of your a*** You seriously calling him a prima donna? Seriously? I think he has handled this situation remarkably well. I know if I was Rodgers, I would have come back to the front office right after that draft and told them to trade me, then gone all on social media explaining how I love the Packers fans, but I dont want to play for a team that doesnt see a future in me, even though Ive said I want to play into my mid 40s.So what? You are gonna call him a prima donna for sitting, not saying anything for a year, not making a big deal over it in the media or anything, and playing it all down when he appears on places like the Pat McAffee show. Then even when it has clear that this offseason Rodgers has been unhappy and negotiating with the Packers for a while, he hasnt said a peep. AND even these reports arent really from him. But you have the gall to call him a prima donna? LOLIn all honesty, I hope Rodgers leaves, and I hope Packers suffer for it, without him you wont even make it to the playoffs for the next several years.	1293	0.9439	team	0	gwhq34a	This wasnt about competition though.

They have a similar skillset with being able to play anywhere on the DL. Ballard seems pretty done with the Lewis experiment and Banogu is probably on the chopping block as well. This seems like a bit of a reach and maybe we were banking on getting Dillon. But with how quick we picked him, Ballard must see a bunch of potential. This points to our DL depth getting blown up at some point in the near future.

1619831057.0	Broncos	Ojemudia landed in the doghouse for his tackling last year. I doubt the staff views him as a safety. Callahan is on the last year of his contract, Fuller only signed a one year deal and will likely cash in next season, it doesnt make sense to move Ojemudia to safety in the long term, he could end up being CB3 next season depending on how next off season goes. Would much rather just take an actual safety and let him and Ojemudia develop	439	0.7096	team	0	gwhqqob	Ojemudia landed in the doghouse for his tackling last year.

1619831117.0	Eagles	Read the rest of my comment. Or do any scouting on the player youve decided is a luxury lol.Hes the only player in the draft to start at all 5 positions on the line. Hes incredibly versatile. Hes not just the absolute best center in the draft, hed also be at the top of the draft for most positions on the line.Thats why he isnt a luxury. He can both play on the line alongside Kelce and learn from him in practice.We arent going to have a oneseason rebuild. Thats simply not possible with the age of our team and our contract situation. Its a multiyear fix. Its shortsighted to narrowly focus on next season. This pick still manages to give us an edge next year while also providing us serious utility over the next 10, in the form on AllPro center to replace our AllPro center.Incidentally, centers have one of the lowest bust rates of all prospects drafted in early rounds. Its purely a question of health, and our medical staff have evidently decided hes good to go. If he stays healthy, the likelihood of him not becoming a dominant linesman are very, very, very low.Who would you have drafted?	1099	0.9062	team	0	gwhquq9	Read the rest of my comment.

1619831309.0	Cardinals	Oh to be honest, I didnt realize it was an opt out season (that makes me feel better) but still some injuries that concern me. I thought Marshall woulda been a better risk, but two other small receivers went after Moore did and Marshall is still on the board. There has to be something we dont know because theres no way he should be dropping this much on talent alone tbhLike I said, I support Moore and will cheer my a** off for him, but I dont know how h*** fit. Especially with Kirk back in the slot and Green and Dhop outside. I cant even see Moore trying to play outside. Bit of a head scratcher, but if the experts think hes a steal and everyone is comparing him to Hill, Im sure Ill be eating crow with my comment lol	725	0.9567	team	0	gwhr7vh	Oh to be honest, I didnt realize it was an opt out season (that makes me feel better) but still some injuries that concern me.

1619831370.0	Broncos	Youre absolutely right. Teddy is a very serviceable quarterback and if youre only looking at last year and not New OrleansMinnesota years then youre being biased for no reason. We dont only look at players last years when we judge them. Teddy cannot carry a team on his own. Carolina is garbage. New first year head coach, new team culture trying to be installed.. he was in a situation that was expecting too much of him. I read a stat, teddy was near the bottom of the barrel in yards per play or plays downfield but he had the least negative yardage plays. He could thrive in our system like he did in New Orleans. Good defense plus offensive weapons to use, thats literally denver. And he went 50 in New Orleans. Would not be surprised at all if he ends up finding success with us next year and wins 9 games. He doesnt even have to win the games on his own. He just has to manage them and essentially not lose the games. Which hes great at, as evident with 50 start in New Orleans and being the best at avoiding negative plays. Plus. Am I the only one who sees the bigger picture here? Us passing on fields makes it super clear to me that were going after Rodgers or Watson if things cool down. Its not every offseason where two franchise qb nfl mvp type players are available for trade(three if you count Russel Wilson situation). Everyone knows our roster is a qb away from being instant super bowl contenders. I think I saw PFF or Rotoworld rank us the 6th best roster in the nfl. Its why the odds for the broncos to win the Super Bowl went from 6600 at 745 pm last night to 2000 when the news that Rodgers to Denver had real an actual chance of happening. Its still 2000 as of now and we havent even traded for Rodgers yet! Its clear as day to me that our front office is absolutely going after Rodgers or Watson. I dont buy into the dont get your hopes up line of thinking as you can tell. Passing on fields was the final sign that I know were going to make a serious run at trading for Rodgers or Watson.	2014	0.997	team	0	gwhrc0n	Youre absolutely right.

1619831384.0	Giants	He was in the Heisman running until the final week of the season (which is why you heard so much about him) and then had the worst game of his life in their bowl game. However, he is an absolute statue in the pocket and offers no mobility skills whatsoever. He also has a weak arm although he is generally accurate. Better college QB than pro prospect.	352	-0.6249	team	0	gwhrcyw	He was in the Heisman running until the final week of the season (which is why you heard so much about him) and then had the worst game of his life in their bowl game.
