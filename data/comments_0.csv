But by the way SP talked in his interview he mist have a deal lined up with a guy like Sherman to fill that particular need for us.	408	0.3506	team	0	gwgsz12	The nfl teams boards are way different than scouts.

1619814248.0	Packers	I dont think so. Him retiring only frees up 20 million or so next year. If you offer the tag you cant spread the cap hit over multiple years. 20 million is not enough to cover the tags of a receiver and a corner.

1619819428.0	Broncos	Been a Broncos fan my whole life. Born and raised. And for the first time since Ive been watching them, I feel zero hope for them going into the season. No desire to watch whatever subpar product theyre putting out there. If their scouts had Surtain above Fields on their big boards, then I question their acumen. So Ill wait for them to hit the reset button. If I gave a s*** what fans thought of it, would I be here? Denver rolls into the season with Lock and BW, they deserve whatever happens next. Which is likely another season with a promising defense (boy, have we heard that before?) and an offense that could be interesting if the QB play improves (this story sounds real familiar), which in the end will lead to missing the playoffs with a totally stagnant offense yet again. The Broncos are definitively the odd man out in the AFC West.	847	0.3991	team	0	gwh3tn0	Been a Broncos fan my whole life. Born and raised.

1619819439.0	Packers	I agree, we definitely have a stacked team and hopefully we get some depth with the draft, I like the Snokes pick so far. We also would have had a fantastic shot at beating the Chiefs in the SB. We lost the NFCCG because of the same defensive woes from all season in the first half, then the offense stalling out in the second. So its a mixed bag. But the thing is all of this really comes crashing down without Rodgers. And we spent TONS of money to keep all those players. The packers are really screwed mediumlong term (and arguably short term) with cap and contracts. We have 0 receivers, 0 CBs on contract for 2022 and tons of other FAs. Obviously everyone expects to resign Adams and Jaire, and probably put tender on Lazard, MVS but that just continues to drain the cap. Its not a great time to have to roll out a completely unknown although very talented rookie QB. Its not that any particular scenario (keep rodgers, trade him away, draft replacement, win now, rebuild, etc.) are bad, its that were trying to do all of them simultaneously for some reason.	1064	-0.7087	team	0	gwh3ujp	I agree, we definitely have a stacked team and hopefully we get some depth with the draft, I like the Snokes pick so far.

There is a difference between a licensed massage therapist and somebody give them a rub down. One does it under a license granted to them after training by the state of Texas the other one is breaking the law. You are also quick to make assumptions about peoples character.

If it is a unlicensed therapist it will blow it up.I have no idea if he is guilty or innocent. When the license massage therapist try their case we will find out. There was a team called Duke lacrosse. The court of public opinion is not a court of law.My guess is he has a sexual addiction.

Anyway, hardly anyone takes RBs in the first round anymore so it was controversial.I was referring to reaches.

Its nice to see that all those a******* that were making s*** up are now doing the right thing, and just blatantly lying in order to save their good names. The Schefter thing is completely obnoxious.

1619819888.0	Packers	I disagree. I dont think this is the same as Favre, when he held the team hostage with his will I or wont I retired. I think this has been our front office really, and I mean really, f****** things up. They drafted Love, which was beyond s****** and Rodgers, rightly, got pissed. I mean, how else was he supposed to take it? They drafted a QB in the first round after they just made the NFCCG. How do you not take that as an insult? They didnt believe in him. They didnt. Rodgers proved them wrong. Then, they come back to him and ask him to restructure his deal. Why should he? They signed the contract, then honor it. Its easy for us to say, he has enough money!    Why does he need more?! Last year, Gute shouldve drafted a WR and rolled with Rodgers. He didnt. He f***** up, badly. So I get why Rodgers is pissed. I dont know what the extension looks like. None of us does. Maybe it was an insulting figure for a reigning MVP. And hey, you can check my post history, I am not some super Rodgers fanboy, either. When this board was bending backwards trying to make the argument that Rodgers is the real GOAT I stated time after time that he wasnt and it was p******* to keep trying to make the argument.	1206	-0.9755	team	0	gwh4sew	I disagree.

If you factor in everything they gave up for the 3, they essentially would have given up three first round picks, a third, the best TE in the league, and some other random picks for Rodgers. Trade might be worth it for us but I dont know how they look at it and go yeah that seems like a good idea.	600	0.9231	team	0	gwh52xf	San Fran has a lot of good players.

In fact, it probably is the only thing that truly puts a trade on the table. Until we hear anything directly from him, Ill continue to assume this is part of the negotiation process.He felt burned by the Love pick and now feels like if the Packers are just doing whats best for the Packers then Aaron is just doing whats best for Aaron. So this glovesoff style of negotiations is fair game now.Im of the opinion that at the end of the day, a contract extension is likely whats best for both parties and thats what will happen. Rodgers will say that the media overstated everything even though his camp leaked everything just how its being reported and the two parties will coexist for another 5 years.(Also, saying Ill say this once is super annoying as if were all hanging on your every word)	1125	0.9794	team	0	gwh5aop	IMO Rodgers is pulling out all the stops for his extension negotiation and thats what all of this is.

Yeah, the only thing I really thought he did well at was catching the ball out of the backfield. Just my opinion. We did sign Malcolm Brown as a goaline back, though.

He also has the toughness to be a raven and plays heavier than he is which helps fill that big physical WR role that we have been lacking, giving Lamar a nice safety blanket and opening up the middle a bit for our run game.	549	0.9441	team	0	gwh6spy	His routes seemed too rounded a lot of the time so he didnt get much separation in short routes and we already have a guy like that in Hollywood.

So presumably they had worked into the second tier of players and there were enough to go around that wed get a player of equal value to us at 20 that we would have at 11.  Toney looks that good he may have been the pick at 11 anyway so we got a first and 2 lower picks for free. Its a fantastic situation to be in imo.

And dont get me wrong, I understand that a lot of people, athletes especially, attribute their good fortunes to a god and feel that they need to thank god for their success. I get it and I expect some of that. But he steered every question back to that and he was super preachy about it. According to Parsons, the fact that he wanted to go to Dallas and then Dallas drafted him is proof of the existence in god, and then his next answer to a completely unrelated question turned into all of his success being attributed to believing in god and not only that, but that everyone needs to accept Jesus as our lord and savior to have success in life.Again, totally a pet peeve of mine and maybe not something that bothers everyone but it was just over the top and annoying to me.

Regardless, with Aaron or without, were still the Packers. Id hate to see him go but well still keep trucking if he isnt out QB1. Probably quite a bit suckier  but without Aaron around itll expose a lot of flaws he may have been compensating for. Also, Shailene Woodley lives part time in Boulder but thats 100 a coincidence.	451	-0.1531	team	0	gwh7810	So is the front office just saying were not trading Aaron just to keep phone calls and offers from pouring in?

Thats a big f****** deal  especially in a game that is being driven by QBs more than ever. We sit back and watch Green Bay get handed division titles and free trips to the playoffs simply because they have the best QB in the division. When Rodgers leaves that team will be us. You also picked out one of the the worst games of his collegiate career. Everyone agrees Trevor Lawrence was the 1 QB in the draft this year. Fields took a s*** on Clemson while Lawrence stood by helpless. But Mitch was a 2 pick, too, and he sucked donkey balls! Here is what we know about Fields vs. Mitch  Fields can step up in a pocket... Mitch cant. Fields can throw deep...Mitch cant. Fields has a good mind for the game...Mitch is dumber than a bag of doorknobs.  Fields is handsome...Mitch is ugly. And yeah, Mitch can run  but he never ran a 4.4. I am not telling you to be happy about it, but you can be content that we got a good QB.	1231	0.9798	team	0	gwh79k8	I am a skeptic, too.

We currently have Benny Snell, Jaylen Samuels, and Anthony McFarland. All of which arent starters.

1619821259.0	Packers	I was referring more to the fanbase and their feeling about what happened. In 2005, the prevailing attitude was anger that Ted Thompson should have gotten Favre more weapons to win. I personally was NOT thrilled with the Rodgers pick. I understood it, but I didnt love it.I dont expect Rodgers to be happy that the Packers drafted his potential replacement. Who wouldnt be a little pissed? I think those hurt feelings in no way justify what hes pulled in the last 24 hours, however.	482	-0.9396	team	0	gwh7mm4	I was referring more to the fanbase and their feeling about what happened.

1619821274.0	Bears	Id rather protect Fields first. We dont want him to retire early like Andrew Luck.  Even if there are other lineman available in the 2nd, why risk them being gone by the third?  I can see the allure of getting more weapons, but weapons didnt save Mahomes in the Super Bowl when he had no time to throw. Once we have a solid foundation, other players will want to come here and we can get those final pieces to push us over the top. OL and CB are bigger needs now.  Plus WR is pretty deep in this draft.	502	0.5726	team	0	gwh7nqa	Id rather protect Fields first. We dont want him to retire early like Andrew Luck.

1619821344.0	Raiders	The reality is the sport of football is extremely complicated and cerebral as much as it is physcial. The draft, the salary cap, free agency, all of these things are being ran by people who make multimillion dollars a year because they put in the time and energy to better understand the sport, and to best be equipped to make the best decision they can.The vast majority of fans watch ALL sports as a reality tv show that never ends. Most dont understand the actual intricacies of the sport, and when its a sport like football, there are so many different positions and skillsets that matter in the NFL it makes it even more daunting. Things like the draft are exciting, but 99.9 of all NFL fans are making their opinions based purely on conjecture, narratives, and the research of other people. Almost all fans simply put are regurgitating the thoughts and feelings of media personalities or draft grades or whatever nonsense they look to.If these media personalities like Mel Kiper and Todd Mcshay were as good as they pretend to be at their job, they would be top tier scouts or GMs. Hence why someone like Mayock who consistently performed as a good media analyst was hired to do exactly that but not from the sidelines. Why the f*** does anyone care what Mel Kiper says? The dude has been an on tv NFL scout for like 40 years and not once has ever been in a NFL organization. He started his career trying to sell his scouting reports to teams, when no NFL team gave him the time of day he started selling it to fans, and eventually was able to sell it to ESPN, who in turn use him as a narrative pusher to get ratings, clicks and views, hes a tv personality, not a NFL scout with any track record.	1703	0.9747	team	0	gwh7sxs	The reality is the sport of football is extremely complicated and cerebral as much as it is physcial.

Someone dismissed me with exactly the same comment about people who are paid millions to make the decision. Three (3) years later, they are  scrambling to shore up their defense,  and Beckham did not even contribute Browns post season record.	746	0.8169	team	0	gwh7zue	 took a late 1st round gamble on the guy who was projected to go there or early in the 2nd anyway????And these are the same people who know better than a random redditor, because they are paid millions.

1619821447.0	Vikings	I think the advantage we have at the moment is there are some quality tackles still on the board.  Eichenberg, Jenkins, Cosmi and Mayfield are generally projected to be tackles and are on the board. This isnt a particularly deep draft but where it does have depth is on the offensive line. Dont be surprised if we trade for future draft picks. Spielman talks about all the players going back for another year and the low total number of players in this draft. I fully expect Spielman to leverage a 4th this year into a 3rd for next year when the draft will be deeper.	567	-0.7399	team	0	gwh80f3	I think the advantage we have at the moment is there are some quality tackles still on the board.

All RBs left after Williams are question marks. With no more 3 down backs left, drafting a RB before the 5th seems like bad value for Miami. Jenkins is a mauler  I really hope he makes it to 18.

Trey has the least passing attempts in the last 40 years of any 1st round qb. I think it could be a good way to get him some reps.

My guess is they wont resolve it this summer and Rodgers will play really well next year and then the Packers might have to give it up and give Rodgers the extention he wants next offseason. Its also possible that Rodgers doesnt play all that well next season and the Packers are more sure about cutting ties once his contract is up.Right now, Rodgers has the leverage, coming off of an MVP season one game from the superbowl, so he releases the news that hes unhappy to try and force the Packers to do an extention sooner rather than later, because who knows when h*** have the leverage again.Its possible the more sinister articles are correct and Rodgers truly is gonna just retire or sit out, but I believe the media is just running away with speculation when the issue is much more simpler than that.	1237	-0.4206	team	0	gwharjc	Exactly this.Rodgers has said he wants to play into his 40s.

1619823037.0	Giants	Trust me, I cant stand people who think being a blind homer makes you a better fan (whatever that means). I was (and still am) very, very critical of the Saquon and Jones picks weeks before they even happened and thought I provided well reasoned thoughts on why. Ive been called a hater and a secret Eagles fan at times because of it.As someone who loves the draft and watches a lot of college football (honestly got started watching it many years ago because of the draft) it is frustrating to see blanket statements like we needed an edge rusher or who is this guy?!?! I think edge was an overrated need for us in the first place but this edge class was weak as h**** The first true edge player didnt get selected until 19 and that speaks volumes. I know a lot of people wanted Kwity Paye for example but he is NOT a pass rusher. Maybe he can develop into one some day but right now he is an athletic freak who is a good edge setter in the run game but a mediocre pass rusher. Sounds like pretty much everyone else on our DL at the moment. And if you think he can eventually develop proper pass rushing technique than why cant Toney improve his route running (remember this past season was his first honest attempt at developing a route tree)? Again Im using you in the general sense here.	1291	0.8351	team	0	gwhb69i	Trust me, I cant stand people who think being a blind homer makes you a better fan (whatever that means). I was (and still am) very, very critical of the Saquon and Jones picks weeks before they even happened and thought I provided well reasoned thoughts on why. Ive been called a hater and a secret Eagles fan at times because of it.As someone who loves the draft and watches a lot of college football (honestly got started watching it many years ago because of the draft) it is frustrating to see blanket statements like we needed an edge rusher or who is this guy?!?! I think edge was an overrated need for us in the first place but this edge class was weak as hell. The first true edge player didnt get selected until 19 and that speaks volumes. I know a lot of people wanted Kwity Paye for example but he is NOT a pass rusher. Maybe he can develop into one some day but right now he is an athletic freak who is a good edge setter in the run game but a mediocre pass rusher. Sounds like pretty much everyone else on our DL at the moment. And if you think he can eventually develop proper pass rushing technique than why cant Toney improve his route running (remember this past season was his first honest attempt at developing a route tree)? Again Im using you in the general sense here.

Or more importantly, that starting 5 will generally play less than half the games as a whole unit. Also, it keeps guys from playing injured more. If Schwartz is injured but we have no replacement, h*** play anyhow.

The collarbone was off a deliberate excessive hit and would have f***** up anyone. His injuries were amplified by an only okay team at the time. Rodgers had less help than Favre though or rather the FO had more ability to improve the current team with Rodgers than Favre. And just because we had a similar situation with Favre doesnt mean we want a repeat of it in mere hopes we get a SB chance down the road during a rebuild.	554	0.5635	team	0	gwhbmoa	Big wrong there.

No NFL player goes injury free, but he was tough enough to play through anything until a back injury than even he cant play through.That said, if there is an OL that can come back from the injury and play its him. I hope he can pass a physical and we bring him back. He could teach the young guys a lot about technique, being he has been one of the best technicians in the game.

They had pretalks with the Eagles for this exact scenario. They did consider making multiple trade downs, but they decided the value of Parsons was too great to keep trading away. Micah Parsons had a natural grade higher than either corner    My interpretation here is that it doesnt mean he wouldve been picked over the corners, but it was a contributor to them not wanting to give value to trade up.	695	0.9628	team	0	gwhbq07	You should go listen the postdraft interview.

He was coached by QB guru David Cutcliffe at Duke. If hes still iffy with accuracy after 3 years with Cutcliffe, is there much room for him to grow with NFL coaching?

I hate the packers with a passion but I side with Aaron Rodgers in the sense that the GB front office has done almost every single thing possible to p*** him off. They are a disgrace for not helping out their qb when they are so close to winning it all.	345	-0.3362	team	0	gwhc60x	Other than devante their receivers are average at best.

Unless we can trade him. As for Cam, I agree hes showing his age and replacing him for the future is a concern, but after hes 32 and after his restructure were paying him 20m for the next two years and cant cut him without a big dead cap number until 2024. If we hadnt restructured his deal like this, Id be fine with the Turner pick, but as it is weve given up one big benefit of 1st round picks which is the cap savings. We wont benefit financially from this pick until 2023 at the earliest, and thats if Turner ends up being good.	731	0.9539	team	0	gwhccb3	The problem I have with the pick is more on the roster management side.We literally picked up Davenports 5th year option yesterday morning, locking him in through 2022 with a 10m guaranteed salary.

1619823747.0	Packers	This is why I dont think the trade rumors make any sense. Rodgers knows his career is over if we trade him because theres no other team thats going to be able to put up the contract he wants  take the trade hit and still be competitive, even if we trade him for nothing past June 1st. He doesnt want to go out like Favre and hes well on his way right now. This is why I would say its probably more reasonable he just retires and stays retired. Its gonna sound dreary for awhile I think. More articles will come out saying how hes displeased and this or that as its not only great clickbait, it also keeps pressure on the FO. If Rodgers buckles and decides to play under current contract he really doesnt do himself any favors unless he earns MVP again. I do think theres a good chance the Packers throw in the towel and give him the guaranteed money. He may lower his asking price as time goes on too. Now theres virtually zero trade leverage so its basically sign something or retire. Packers FO isnt f****** around. Gutes taking a huge hit for it but in the end, how bad would Gute look if Rodgers got another long, expensive, extension and then started sucking a year into it while we trade away Jordan Love for peanuts? Its a tough situation for both parties.	1263	0.6239	team	0	gwhcjd5	This is why I dont think the trade rumors make any sense.

1619823780.0	Jets	From the articleWeve known the Jets pick at No. 2 for weeks, but that doesnt mean it is the right pick. Look, I like Wilson, and he has elite arm talent, but for the Jets to trade away Sam Darnold, they have to know for sure that Wilson is an upgrade. How can we say that for sure?Darnold got very little help in his three seasons in New York, and hes still only 23. He hasnt come even close to reaching his ceiling yet. The Jets could have used this pick on a massive upgrade around Darnold  most likely tight end Kyle Pitts  but instead theyre starting over with another young quarterback. In fact, the Jets have now taken seven first or secondround signalcallers since 2000, two more than any other franchise in that span.Wilson took a huge leap this past season, improving in every area after an inconsistent 2019. But he did it against a weak schedule, with really good players around him. This Jets draft is going to be defined by whether or not Wilson is a star, and I still have questions. General manager Joe Douglas has to improve the talent around Wilson, something the previous regime wasnt able to do for Darnold.Douglas also traded up with the Vikings to No. 14 for VeraTucker, giving up picks Nos. 23, 66 and 86 (and adding No. 143) to get the clear best guard in this class. I dont have huge qualms with this deal since the Jets didnt have to give up the No. 34 pick, which is hugely valuable. VeraTucker will help Wilson in the passing game and pave lanes in the running game. Its a sensible pick.	1514	0.9948	team	0	gwhcloj	From the articleWeve known the Jets pick at No. 2 for weeks, but that doesnt mean it is the right pick.

1619823784.0	Chiefs	Because it means we would have to cut somebody else that has value beyond returning kicks. Why wouldnt we instead keep guys who can contribute in other ways and are just as good as some 7th round dice roll return specialist? Pringle is as good of a returner as any 7th round specialist and can contribute at WR as well. I get what you are saying about saving the durability of your starters, but we dont have infinite roster spots. Instead of keeping them healthy, it would mean one of them being a healthy scratch so we can suit up a return specialist in case one of the kicks is returnable so they can hopefully get substantially farther than the 25 yard line to make it possibly worthwhile to keep a possible regular contributor off of the active game day roster. It just doesnt make sense. Let Pringle return kicks and be done with it.	839	0.9694	team	0	gwhclzr	Because it means we would have to cut somebody else that has value beyond returning kicks.

We havent seen a pure pocket passer in a while. The only guy I can name recently would be Goff. And realistically,  thats not a guy you want to name as your reference point.Im not saying a pocket passer is dead in this league and cant make it, just that using guys like Brady and Brees is a bad point to say you can do it as they grew before the change in game style.	716	-0.7076	team	0	gwhcuf4	To counter that, we really have no idea on how a snail pocket passer develops in todays game.

Yes, its good for an organization and you want some but truth is, most athletes come from nothing. So yeah, there might be some issues with decisions the players made in the past.

1619823952.0	Eagles	My Eagles 37 Pick Board 1. Jeremiah OwusuKoramoah  If the JOKer is available the Eagles have to take him. Projected mid1st rounder whereas getting him in the 2nd round will be a steal. The Eagles LB depth is getting crowded and we still dont know what we have in Shaun Bradley and Davion Taylor, but JOK is there its a nobrainer to draft him as the stud LB for years to come.2. Asante Samuel Jr  Amongst the Day 2  3 projected CBs it seem like the Eagles have expressed the most interest in ASJ. Unless Howie plans to make a splash to sign a veteran CB like Steven Nelson it only makes sense to take ASJ here to be the ballhawking CB in the Cover 2 scheme similar to his father. 3. Jamar Johnson  Johnson is one of my favorite safety prospects in this draft. Every time I watched Indiana he stuck out like a sore thumb on their defense as somebody that had a nose for the ball. As a hybrid safety thats best suited for split zone heavy coverage hes still versatile enough to buckle down and defend WRs in mantoman coverage. Trevon Moehrig is widely considered the best safety remaining but Im not as high on him, specifically his upside, as the pundits are. Andre Cisco would be a good option here too but him coming off a torn ACL make me think of former Eagles safety Nate Allen. Richie Grant is a solid option here too as a ballhawk with versatility but his height at 511 concerns me a little bit.4. Daviyon Nixon  Nixon here is simple. We need insurance for Fletcher Cox and we need a DT we can groom to be his replacement in 23 years. Nixon couldve been a 1st rounder based on upside alone. At 63 and 305lbs hes an agile pass rusher with burst off the line thats adept to batting down passes but hes also a quality run stopper as well. 5. Creed Humphrey  Humphrey here is probably a last ditch effort to get BPA if the prospects that we want and need are off the board already. Humphrey is a quality C prospect that has some camaraderie with Hurts at Oklahoma. I wouldnt prioritize taking Humphrey here but the Eagles are likely looking for a C that they could fill in Jason Kelces spot whenever he decides to hang the cleats up which is likely soon.	2155	0.9946	team	0	gwhcxq3	My Eagles 37 Pick Board 1.

1619823959.0	Bears	Penn State and Bears fan here, I despised him in college for obvious reasons and my OSU bias wanted him to bust in the NFL mostly because I didnt think the bears had a shot at him (honestly they shouldnt have, he shouldve been taken 3rd at the latest IMO). With all that said, guy is a legit good Qb. His accuracy is great and can use his legs. He runs a 4.4  Ryan Pace. My concern is OLine giving him time to throw or that he is able to make his reads fast.  Do I think Andy Dalton and  or nick Foles are the best vets to help out Fields? No, but I think its best he sits a year and comes in during garbage time.	613	0.9437	team	0	gwhcy7s	Penn State and Bears fan here, I despised him in college for obvious reasons and my OSU bias wanted him to bust in the NFL mostly because I didnt think the bears had a shot at him (honestly they shouldnt have, he shouldve been taken 3rd at the latest IMO).

I dont find it hard to believe that Miami did. Maybe Tua had some input on the selection and he likes Waddle better? They could also be planning on using him as a returner.

1619824169.0	Packers	Favre waffled on retirement because the team wouldnt commit to him. You have it exactly backwards. Harlan told him he would be the starter as long as he was in charge. When Harlan retired, Favre wanted that same assurance from the new front office, and they wouldnt give it. He begged them to get weapons like Randy Moss. They drafted Rodgers. All of this fueled Favres growing insecurity about the teams plans going forward. Its the same situation all over again. Regardless of whos right or wrong, in both cases the franchise proves to have no personal relationship with their star player having to communicate through the press and gobetweens instead of face to face.	670	-0.7421	team	0	gwhddbu	Favre waffled on retirement because the team wouldnt commit to him.

1619824652.0	Patriots	Yeah I could def see that. Do something like Saints do with Taysom Hill.I am pretty pumped to see this offence this year too. Only thing I wouldnt mind is if Pats went out and got a true number one receiver like Julio or something. Especially if their asking price isnt too high. Not a big need though cause I do like Meyers, and am intrigued by Bourne and Nelson. Plus Harry could potentially turn out this year.	413	0.91	team	0	gwhea1b	Yeah I could def see that.

1619824756.0	Broncos	Im venting here but, I really do not understand how any Broncos fan could be upset about how this draft has turn out so far. We all have our prospects we want whether yours was Justin fields or someone else, but doesnt this defense and its depth blow your mind? I mean having the talent we have now on defense can assure a massive problem some keep forgetting, INJURIES!!! Plus even if youre pissed hes not a quarterback I know Rodgers is way more realistic than Watson, Rodgers is a man who tells it how it is he doesnt play games or sugarcoat stuff like this and I honestly think he definitely has Denver as a hot spot for him. He sees how young the team is, how we have one of the best blind sides in the league, a scary defense, and a team willing to listen to him. The reason the 49ers trade was accepted because they do not want to see that man again if he leaves. They dont want to be risk losing to him within the conference especially in the playoffs which they wouldve seen him if he went to the 49ers. If he goes to the Broncos he can see a plan that WORKS (unlike the clown show down in Vegas) and the best part too is we can get a decent pick for Lock if we get him. I am not saying all of this is guaranteed, but I am saying Rodgers isnt s***** and he hasnt really had a history of hiding anything when he speaks thats why I see him in the orange and blue as the most realistic landing spot now that the first day is done in the draft. But he definitely wont be traded for at least a month the Packers arent that s*****...	1536	0.9604	team	0	gwheha2	Im venting here but, I really do not understand how any Broncos fan could be upset about how this draft has turn out so far.

1619824783.0	Cardinals	He was the BPA without getting good trade down value. I dont believe in Farley from a health perspective and I dont wanna get a RB top 20. The trade up cost to get us a corner wouldve been a murder for us in next years draft, so idk how many other options we have. LB is a big need for us if you look at the second half of last season, just as large as CB in my opinion, I believe in building a team from the inside out. I know we all want an elite, young corner, but considering the value of the pick wed have to trade for to get one with a high floor, it just isnt worth it if we wanna win a SB in the next 2 seasons. A solid front 7 makes our corners better, whereas 2 solid CBs doesnt make our overall run defense better or easier to defend TEs, and at least Butler can tackle unlike every other CB weve had the last 2 seasons, hes at least better than a Pat Pete shell of last year.	887	0.976	team	0	gwhej5d	He was the BPA without getting good trade down value.

I love Andy Reid and dont think anyone could coach the Chiefs like he does. That said, I am confident that you could take almost any NFL assistant coach and throw them in as our head coach and they would win a ton of games, likely make a playoff run, and possibly a SB berth. But Andy built the team and builds off of it. It is sustainable. Unlike Gruden whos raiders tenure ended  .500 before he moved to the Bucs where he inherited a defense full of hall of famers and won a superbowl his first year. Since his SB win hes never won a playoff game.I dont use the F word lightly, but Gruden is 100 a FRAUD. His winningest accomplishment as a LV Raider is a single regular season win against the Chiefs.  I hope Mark Davis goes broke paying Gruden to make poor decisions and rack up losses all while making phenomenal PR moves that convince the front office that he really is their guy. Meanwhile, Im just happy we get to play them twice a year.	1124	0.987	team	0	gwheqg4	Agreed. Ive told people since they hired him that I think hes a moron.

But Andy built the team and builds off of it. It is sustainable. Unlike Gruden whos raiders tenure ended  .500 before he moved to the Bucs where he inherited a defense full of hall of famers and won a superbowl his first year. Since his SB win hes never won a playoff game.I dont use the F word lightly, but Gruden is 100 a FRAUD. His winningest accomplishment as a LV Raider is a single regular season win against the Chiefs.  I hope Mark Davis goes broke paying Gruden to make poor decisions and rack up losses all while making phenomenal PR moves that convince the front office that he really is their guy. Meanwhile, Im just happy we get to play them twice a year.

If a ring is what Rogers really wants (and I believe that is his prime goal at this point) that is not going to happen in Green Bay.

1619825157.0	Jaguars	Yup.  But now, you have one less pick to pick one of those guys.  We picked Campbell, and now have 1 more pick in the second.  So interior rush, safety, OLine, or tight end gets pushed to the third.

1619825217.0	Packers	Im sorry, but the weapons involve a good line who lost at least one key guy, Adams, Jones.  The rest of the WR would be 3s at best on any other team, and would likely look like 4s with a mid tier guy throwing to them.

1619825588.0	Packers	I like the pick but lets stop pretending we have a perfect receiver corps. Adams is the best in the league and Jones is one of the best receiving running backs but everyone else struggled. Yes, we had the best offense in the league, but imagine if we had even better players. I legit think we would have won the NFCCG and likely the super bowl too if we had drafted receivers or at least immediate impact players in last years draft. x200BOur defense had 3 picks in less than half of the game and we still couldnt get it done. Both sides of the ball were at fault for the loss so I think getting an immediate impact player regardless of position would have been a good pick. Just so happens we went with defense (again) and well have to wait to see if it pays off. I just hope to god it doesnt make Rodgers want to leave even more. We can talk about him being a diva and wanting him to go if his attitude doesnt shape up but the man has done nothing but win for this franchise and wed likely be one of the worst teams in the past 10 years without him.	1051	0.9899	team	0	gwhg3nq	I like the pick but lets stop pretending we have a perfect receiver corps.

He is great no argument from me. But he is not above the team. He does not need to be involved in personnel moves and coaching changes.

1619825881.0	Packers	I dont think the love pick is bad. Agreed there. I have no gripe with Rogers except that Im still a little lost as to what he truly wanted? He has 3 yrs left on his deal right? A great deal with a good to great team. They keep him protected and these offensive woes, in my humble opinion, have been there for the entirety of Rogers quarterbacking. I think its more of a coaching organizational thing honestly but then again Rogers has been the constant during this time. This weird kind of lack of pace and momentum that happens to them when they get behind. Malaise is a disease and it spreads through this team fast when it does.	631	-0.3839	team	0	gwhgo7p	I dont think the love pick is bad. Agreed there.

1619826065.0	Dolphins	From my offseason series Speaking of unpopular defensive draft targets, if the Dolphins have already addressed the edge at 18th overall and the top three running backs are off the board at 36, we might think ahead on defense and take a look at finding a longterm solution at free safety. Drafting either player at 36 might be overdrafting them, but that hasnt stopped this front office in the past. Holland and Johnson might be the two best prospects for deep coverage safeties in the draft this year. Both are ball hawks in coverage Johnson has seven interceptions in 406 coverage snaps and Holland has twenty combined picks and passes defended in two seasons at Oregon. Both have the potential to play both at free safety and as a slot corner in the nickel. Given how many threesafety packages the Dolphins use under Flores, I could easily see either one of these guys getting phased into the offense for the 2021 season only to eventually replace Bobby McCain in 2022 when the Dolphins can save 7,000,000 moving on from him, and adding another turnover threat in the secondary alongside Howard could be the move that keeps our defense ticking.Im rarely so on the money, but cool.	1182	0.989	team	0	gwhh172	From my offseason series Speaking of unpopular defensive draft targets, if the Dolphins have already addressed the edge at 18th overall and the top three running backs are off the board at 36, we might think ahead on defense and take a look at finding a longterm solution at free safety.

1619826324.0	Cowboys	Thank you. Your interpretation is almost certainly correct because of the fact that they chose to use the qualifier natural when making that statement.   To me this indicates that they thought Parsons was merely the superior physical talent, however I can almost guarantee they are attributing a positional value in their analysis on top of natural talent.   I watched the press conference as well and I got the impression they wouldve taken a CB but essentially didnt want to trade back enough to push them out of the initial pool of 1st round grades that usually runs dry by the mid teens each year.	601	0.8995	team	0	gwhhje8	Thank you.

And they never get there without the Dez play. And the cowboys dont get there without the picked up PI that happened with the Lions.

Plus, he might have to bite people kneecaps, Im not sure if hes up for that.So, Id say its  Rodgers, Cousins, Goff, Fields? until proven differently.If Rodgers leaves, its  Cousins, Goff, Fields? and Love?

The Kylo Han scene is cringe af when they announce that its his memory of his father so its him imagining his dad forgiving him for killing him.

If he can go somewhere to compete for a SB I would like that just as much as if the Jets keep him. I would personally prefer to get draft picks for him but if we can keep him that is just a plus. A good situation either way unless they just release him.	511	0.9246	team	0	gwhifh9	I would love if they kept him. I am not familiar with what he is costing to keep him.

He has pulled the Green Bay cart along for the past 7 or 8 years now with little help. He does have leverage when it comes to the fanbase and the interest of the team. Maybe not contractural leverage, but the Packers could easily get another championship with him leading. And hes also a legitimate finalist option to be the permanent host of Jeopardy. Which is a much sweeter gig than what the Packers and the NFL is offering him right now. Every single year he could sustain a serious andor permanent injury. He deserves guaranteed money for carrying the team, too. Despite all of this, I also dont think this is a leverage play. Heres my thoughts on all of this1. Its overblown b******** He vented some frustrations and it was blown out of proportion. 2. It was released conveniently hours before the draft. 3. Everyone already knew that Rodgers had to be frustrated with how the F.O. has been handling things for awhile now. Its just being said aloud now. The Jordan Love pick was the dumbest thing that an NFL team has done in the past 2 years (excluding the Texans of course). 4. Rodgers addresses these things in person, and has indicated many dozens of times in the past few years that he hates the media for literally this exact type of s**** I wont be worried until Rodgers says something himself.

1619826887.0	Eagles	Opinion The first thing people will say is Injuries, well, he was injured and he went back in. Look past the red flag for a sec and see the player, mans a beast. x200BAnalysis Tough, physical center with very good size. Plays very smart football, and did very well keeping up with the rest of the big guys on the OL for Alabama. Drives and attacks his opponents, finishes, and will easily crash and hit 23 defenders. For someone of his size, he has fast feet and keeps his feet moving. Shows excellent technique, fundamentally sound, good anchor against bull rushes, and keeps a good bend in his knees.  He is coming off a torn ACL, that along with having shorter arms for the ideal center makes means that some may see him as having some skill set limitations. His major red flags will be the injury concerns, 2016 he had a Knee Injury that ended his season. In 2017 another undisclosed injury took him out of the season. In 2018 he played 1 game before ending an Ankle Injury took him out. He was medically redshirted for the 2019 season and played in 2020, ending the SEC championship game vs Florida with an ACL.   Opinion Landon Dickerson will need to show he can stay healthy for a season, luckily, the Eagles will not ask him to come in day 1. He can work on his technique with Kelce, getting better at run blocking while polishing up his pass protection. His injuries are a concern but I have high hopes for him.	1420	0.9256	team	0	gwhin9j	Opinion The first thing people will say is Injuries, well, he was injured and he went back in.
