1619577464.0	Vikings	If Fields is there at 14, the Vikings should absolutely take him. Hes going to be the best chance they have to develop a QB behind Cousins for the next two years and get Cousins enormous salary off the books in 2023. The best chance you have at team success in the NFL is by having a solid QB on a rookie contract and the Vikings have to get out of this cycle of going allin every year to wildly mixed results.	410	0.9493	team	0	gw4n37o	If Fields is there at 14, the Vikings should absolutely take him.
